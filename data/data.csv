1,robbed by my date this morning..,16269,1499,19/05/2022,"Update #5 June 3rd the entirety of my money has been refunded to me today and the police have all of the information they need and have put out a warrant for stealing both my debit and credit card which is a felony warrant and then the county where my card was used put out a retail fraud warrant for her stealing merchandise after a failed attempt at using my card, not sure if they will actually contact me when she's finally captured but I'm sure I will have to appear in court

Update #4

This all happened the morning of the 19th or 20th, can't recall exactly, whatever day this post was made..

Today is the 28th, I've spoken with the detective the last two days and he's gone to every location my cards were used at and has viewed the security footage so all that business is over with, they've put felony warrants out for her arrest, 

Yesterday an officer from the county the Walmart is located in contacted me and asked if I could also share the information about the theif because on her last attempt to use my card after it was locked she walked out of the store with all of their merchandise she couldn't pay for which was over 100$ in product so they will also be bringing separate charges up against her for that,

She purchased a Greyhound ticket with my card so chances are she's not even in this state anymore and they said the charges would not be extraditable so she won't get picked up there and brought back here but if she ever comes back she's probably got a prison sentence waiting for her since she already has multiple felony theft charges, this is probably the end of the story until that finally happens



Update#3 

30 minutes after update 2 an actual detective from the bureau of investigation contacted me and said by Wednesday he will be stopping at every location a transaction was made and reviewing the footage of every single transaction and she will 100% have at least one felony warrant, 

He said if she did end up taking the Greyhound out of state unfortunately the warrant will not be extraditable but if she ever returns to Michigan which she has children and family here it will catch up to her eventually, 



Update #2

Spoke with Walmart again today they said the detective tried to contact them but they missed the call and have kind of been going back and forth playing phone tag,

The security manager gave me her direct line to email to the officer so that should help,

She said she has footage from each transaction ready for the police to come collect and told me it was the same individual each time using my stolen card and that they also have footage of the vehicle, 

My bank told me they need a copy of the police report in order to credit me the money that was stolen and I guess it's not as simple as just going down to the station and requesting it, I have to email the Police department and request that it be sent to the police department for me to pick up then I have to pay around $10 for it which I'm fine with.

The lady was kind of rude and said it would only contain whatever they have investigated so far like it was a waste of time for me and I told her I didn't really care because I need it to send to my bank so I can get my money back. 






Update, I'm the guy who's debit card was stolen by a tinder date yesterday, 

I invited a girl over for dinner drinks and a movie, woke up and she was gone which I was fine with. Checked my phone to see what time it was and noticed multiple transactions I didn't recognize.

Immediately canceled my card and reported it stolen, they said my funds will be sent back to me by June 1st so that's not an issue.

The police arrived at my house 45 minutes later, they had me send screenshots of each transaction and pictures of the girl ect,

 one of the transactions included a Greyhound ticket.

 While talking to the girl in person she mentioned she had moved here from Alabama two years ago so I assumed that's where the ticket was for and going to the Greyhound website based off the price of the ticket I was able to confirm that was more than likely true seeing as a next day Greyhound ticket cost the same amount that was charged to my card

 The police were notified of the departure times for today so hopefully she is apprehended at the Greyhound station,

I tried calling Greyhound multiple times and each time it said they were experiencing high call volumes and to leave a message so I left them multiple messages not that I thought it would help or anything but I figured it couldn't hurt.

 So my money is already being refunded and the police have been emailed all of the evidence needed, my only concern now is that this girl doesn't get away with what she's done and she is apprehended before getting on that bus and leaving the state, if she does manage to do that I already know the county she lives in out there so I will be contacting them as well, I would go up to the Greyhound station myself if it wasn't for the fact I have to work tomorrow, 

A lot of people were asking how she could have even accessed my account without the PIN number, the answer is simple usually when you use a debit card out of cash register even though it's a debit card you have the option to run it as credit for some reason. Which I personally never even do myself because supposedly there's more issues with transaction history and pending transactions when you do it that way, luckily for me when I reported it stolen 30 minutes after all of the transactions all of them were still pending which helped me out a lot

As far as the online Greyhound purchase went I'm pretty sure she would have at least needed my address.

 Every time I've ever used my debit card for an online purchase the only info I needed was the name of the card holder which is visible on the card, my address which I gave to her so she could show up at my house unfortunately, and the three digit security pin on the back of my card which would have also been visible to her.

This happened almost 24 hours ago, the police originally came over to take a statement and gave me an email address to send all of the evidence to, 

They then came back about an hour later with six folders containing six different mugshots of different individuals for a photo lineup and I was able to pick the person out who stole my card.

The police department opens in 3 hours and I will be contacting the investigating officer immediately to see if there's anything else I need to do before the departure times of the Greyhound tickets pass, 

I haven't contacted this individual yet to let them know I'm aware of what they've done in hopes they would let their guard down and not go off hiding, we met on tinder but moved the conversation to Facebook so we could video chat before meeting, big mistake of this is what she planned to do all along because she originally gave me a different last name and looking through her Facebook posts I was able to see she shared multiple posts from an account with the same first name as her but a different last name.

One of the transactions sent from my card was a Facebook payment to a single individual with the same last name as her so that person has been brought into the investigation as well, 

There were multiple payments at a speedway gas station and a Walmart, I'm guessing this girl doesn't work or hasn't for a while at least and is unaware of how far Bank apps have come these days because clicking on the Walmart transactions through my banking app actually tell me the exact date time and location of the Walmart the transactions or processed at so the police said they would be going up there and asking for security camera footage as well. I don't know about where you guys live but that Walmart's around here it's pretty much self checkouts that have front facing cameras just like ATMs do so she's pretty much screwed there..

If the police sound like they aren't going to be able to take care of the issue I plan on messaging this person and letting them know it's probably not in their best interest to get on that Greyhound bus because I will be up there waiting with the police in hopes that will scare them enough to trap them in the town I live.  

I think that about covers everything everyone was questioning and the previous post, hopefully the grammar is a little better for all the people complaining about that, 

For anybody asking for more private information I will definitely look into the rules of this sub and give out whatever information I'm able to, I feel like if she is arrested that would be public information and not be considered doxing if I shared it but I will have to look into it. I'm grateful for everybody who's been supportive thank you very much this was a pretty messed up day for me, definitely not how I wanted to spend my last day off of the week, I invited her to come out kayaking with me this morning so it's a little embarrassing having had this happen after thinking she was so polite and kind, 

I would definitely like to raise awareness for this type of thing happening to men, I always knew it was a possibility but I've been on countless dates just like this where we hang out at my place the first night after dinner or whatever, I've never really worried about someone stealing something right there while I'm present, my wallet wasn't laying out in the open or anything it was on my side of the bed at the base of the mattress and I didn't put it there for her to see so she legit must have searched around for it,

I woke up with an extremely bad migraine today as well so I am a little bit concerned she may have possibly put something in my drink because I didn't drink a lot last night at all and we had a big dinner and I've been drinking a lot of fluids lately since it's been warmer out the past two weeks, 

Hopefully that covers any questions anybody could possibly have, Police department opens up in two and a half hours I'll be calling them right away and I will update this post if anything happens, the Greyhound tickets are for either 3:00 p.m. today or 6:00 p.m. today, it's 6:35 a.m. at the time I'm typing this, if nothing happens by that point then unfortunately the police just didn't put enough effort in and she's probably in a different state, 

It would be really upsetting if that happened since I pretty much did all of the investigative work on finding out her real name, comparing the prices for the tickets to figure out that was the proper location of the purchase, pulling up the transactions to pinpoint the exact Walmart the money was spent at, 

I was really looking forward to the police contacting me later on yesterday telling me she had been apprehended I'm hoping they are sending somebody up to Greyhound, my only concern about that is the Greyhound station is in a different county that is 30 minutes away so I'm not sure how the different departments will cooperate with each other on that, if I have to before confronting the girl personally I will contact the different department and let them know what's going on with the situation. 

Sorry for this huge wall of text, but there was a lot of people saying their original post was hard to read and asking for more information, this is everything there is to know right here and I will update anything new happens thank you.",robbed,update june rd entirety money refunded today police information need put warrant stealing debit credit card felony warrant county card used put retail

I am totally fine dating curvy/chubby women and I dated in the past as well but I felt so disappointed and cheated that I just had some bullshit excuse and ended the meeting. 

Why would somebody do that ? Like what are you expecting during the meeting ?

3,Tinder Secretly Removed A Major Benefit of Tinder Plus Subscription,4800,538,01/11/2021,"I've had Tinder Plus (the least-expensive of the 3 tiers of subscriptions) for about 6 months. Among the few things you get from the 'Plus Tier' is 5 daily super likes. All of a sudden I realize I'm not getting any super likes at all, I assume maybe my subscription ended for some reason and I go to resubscribe and lo-and-behold, I still have an active Tinder Plus subscription, still paying the same amount for the service. I look it up and see that tons of people over the past few months have noticed they're no longer getting daily super likes. I honestly cannot fathom how Tinder thinks it's okay to completely remove a key feature of a subscription service, not make the subscription cheaper, and not even tell their customers that they're no longer receiving all that they're paying for. Tinder is already such an unbelievably shady service, with shadow banning paying customers, hiding matches behind paywalls, and giving fake notifications to trick people into paying for Gold. This is the cherry on top. I guess I shouldn't be surprised, Tinder is a giant scam of an app and most people on it abuse it's poor mechanics. Just thought I'd share my frustration to see how many other people are sharing these feelings.

5,Underagers,3202,225,15/07/2019,"I've been noticing an odd trend in my own tinder experience lately, I have had a handful of girls that turned out to not be their age on tinder in just the last week. Most recently, a girl I added on snapchat was taking senior pictures.. And rightfully so, I let her know how stupid it is to lie about your age. So, I figured I'd make a thread about being smart on dating apps, because some people are absolutely not. 

For the girls, you are not cute for being a minor hitting up dudes that are not minors. It's not cute to like older guys when you're 15, 16, 17. It's illegal. Especially if you are lying about your age. Depending on your state, sending dirty pictures is child pornography, dirty talk could be used against you in court as intent, and anything physical can absolutely be statutory rape. For the guy, all of the above will be implications to be labeled a sex offender for life, in the case of child pornography, that'll be both the girl and guy. 

Be smart, know your local laws, and for the love of God, if they are not 18, tell them to fuck off. A quick thrill is not worth a lifetime of labels. 

Be smart out there.

Not long later she calls me while I’m driving to her asking if I can drive her somewhere (coincidentally I know this area well and it’s a bunch of backroads to go pick up her debit card supposedly. She said she got in a car wreck a week ago and doesn’t have a car to drive herself and asked if I could give her a ride along the way. Two red flags went off in my head when I heard this (1. She’s either trying to use me to run errands for her or (2. She’s trying to set me up to get robbed by making me drive out into the sticks. I ended up no-showing and blocking her number and reporting her profile.

9,IT WAS NOT A SCAM??!!,360,41,16/04/2022,"I never had much luck on Tinder, few likes and the ones I got the girls quickly lost interest, old story.

I recently had a match with a girl and I didn't have to keep trying to keep the conversation going??? She was genuinely interested and wanted to keep talking???

The strangest thing was that she wanted to meet already the next day. We arrange to meet at a mall and do whatever comes to our minds. 

When I was waiting for her all I could think about was ""Some guy's going to show up"" or ""She's going to kidnap me"" or something. But then she appeared and she was just as beautiful as in the picture, WITHOUT MAKEUP.

From there we did a lot of things, walking, eating, going to an escape room, and in the end we even went to a motel???? (Our homes were not available) 

We split the bill for everything and she even drove me back home (I don't have a car)????

10,My observations/tips from Tindering for almost a year.,191,32,29/07/2015,"I was late to the Tinder game and only had it for a few months before the limited likes thing took into effect. That being said, a lot of things have stayed the same and here are my experiences and observations as a semi-active Tinderer for the last year.

A lot of this can be found around this subreddit but here is an aggregate spot for it all and some of my own observations. None of this is empirical but all anecdotal which I know resonates with some of you as well. 

**ABOUT ME:** 5'11, 155, Latino, 22 year old male living in a moderately sized metropolitan city. I'm a 7/10 in real life(plenty of people have called me cute/handsome/hot. I have pretty good facial features and good style but large nose and crooked teeth and some acne scarring. So I'm attractive but just some things that stop me from being an 8 or a 9 or 10) but a 6/10 on Tinder, if that(lots of competition and not the most photogenic person). I am a right swiper who unmatches the matches he doesn't feel(if I don't find them too attractive but we have a lot in common I won't unmatch them because a fun conversation with someone who shares interests with you is good too). So I'm picky with who I put my dick into but I'm not too picky with who I'm gonna keep as a match, so accounting for that on average **I get about 10 matches a day**. It's ok, not as good as a lot of you handsome folk on here but the important thing is that **I have improved immensely from my 1 match a day** from before even when Tinder didn't limit swipes and girls were less picky. I also don't like to talk about numbers because it's pretty tacky in most situations, but for the sake of this post **my number is 10, and 7 of those were from Tinder**. I also don't like rating girls but they average 6.5 or 7/10.

**1. The shitty camera phone pictures of me doing stuff were almost as successful as the crisp DSLR portraits.** Before I got a DSLR I had a bunch of pictures of me playing pool, visiting Chicago, playing guitar, maybe 1 portrait in all of it. There was a huge quality difference especially when I edited the camera pictures on the stock Android editor and edited the DSLR pics in Adobe Lightroom. However, the camera pictures seemed to garner as many matches as the DSLR portraits so I had to add some DSLR quality action shots(guitar, kitty, more pool) for it to make a difference. Go figure, I guess girls like handsome guys whose lives are dope and who do dope shit. 

*1b. Don't buy a DSLR, just rent a much nicer one if you need nice photos.* This isn't Tinder specific and I take pictures outside of Tinder purposes but I wish I had done this. I've probably used my camera 3 days in the last few months since I got it. I spent $430 on a Pentax K-50 and Pentax nifty fifty and to know I could have rented a 5D mark II for ~$100 and a 24mm f/1.4L II USM(a $1500+ lens) for ~$30 for a few days I would have just rented.

**2. I swear I get more matches on iOS than Android.** I would get less than a handful of matches a day on Android sometimes, then that number almost doubled when I got an iPod Touch(wanted to try out iOS for cheap) with the same city and same bio. There isn't a logical reason for this I don't think but just something I've noticed.

**3. The more I message my matches, the more matches I get.** Once again I don't know how Tinder's internals work but just another anecdotal observation like the previous one.

**4. Those shirtless bathroom selfies are tacky and will probably even negate you points** unless of course you have ~10% body fat and workout consistently. I mean I have ~15% body fat and workout a few days a week on average, but at 5'11, 157 lbs I have to flex hard and be dehydrated to get modest definition and even then it doesn't count. I just took off the shirtless picture but I might add an artsy, looking away one in the future from a DSLR. 

**5. Don't let race(or any other inhibition) stop you.** Another general life lesson instead of Tinder specifically; I say this with the utmost love. I'm not asian but now and then I get people saying I look Asian, and that might turn off a few on online dating and I definitely get some sympathy pain when I hear about my Asian bros out there getting shafted. I'll admit that I'm not fugly or short, but I've had to shake off a few bouts of inferiority complex, but no one deserves to feel bad for something they can't change like skin color. If anything, I'm using this situation to propel myself to a level where I can show the world every race is beautiful and if you just keep working on yourself those negative feelings will go away. Of course, my self-esteem has improved immensely after graduating college, going on more dates, and getting a job offer from a good job in a good city and generally bettering myself and I bring that energy to Tinder.

**6. Putting *hookups only* on my profile was eh at best.** It wasn't bad. I had some girls say they loved how direct I was. I even had a few cases of the girl coming directly over, after which we immediately banged without any dates. But I also feel that a date beforehand will make the sex better, it will be fun because it's not guaranteed and you have to work for it, and honestly the girls I matched were a little less attractive on average than the girls I had with on a regular profile. So i.e. the returns are greater than the extra energy expended in this case. So I just went back to a profile that doesn't say *hookups only*. I might try it again though when I get better pictures/ a better body. And it's funny because right now I've been getting more action in general(snapchat flirting, numbers, girls displaying more interest) then when I did with the *hookups only* profile. 

**7. A hookup to a girl is different than a hookup to a guy.** Almost any sexually active guy will bang any hot chick on the spot, not the case with a lot of women in my experience(once again I follow rules 1 and 2 but I am no Sean O' Pry). Another reason my hookups only profile wasn't as successful is because their idea of a hookup is to be wined and dined for a couple hours to feel you out(you might murder them, can't blame them) and make sure she's not wasting her time with a scrub, after which if you pass the test you will most assuredly get your dick sucked on the first ""date"". On the other hand, your idea of a hookup is for you guys to get naked as soon as you say hi and fuck on your twin bed. I was going straight for the latter and it was tactless when I'm not at that attractiveness level just yet(but I will be and you will be too). It happened now and then, but had a lower success rate than the former method.

**7. You don't have to put your whole life story in your bio.** I must have listed every single thing I was into at one point and it took up the whole bio: ""long boarding, indie rock, football, kayaking, lifting, ..."" and it's generic and boring. My idea was that the more I listed the more fish I would catch because every fish would see a mutual interest or it would lead to a conversation, but that was very seldom the case. And like I said, a lot of dudes like the same things so it's a waste of space and you'll seem like Tinder Bro #5757574.

**8. A witty/original/humorous bio is a game changer.** Remember that boring generic bio? I changed it to something witty and humorous and my matches doubled. Girls like to laugh and this makes you stand out a bit. That being said, I still added the highlights about me so they know a little about you, you don't seem like a clown, and so they know they're not messing with a fuckboy. Most importantly, girls got to see a snapshot of my creativity, and my quirky and somewhat inappropriate humor but affectionate personality. I can't recommend anything, you have to come up with something or at least Google and add your own twist to it. 

**9. Having group photos, especially with girls, honestly didn't help that much.** I always heard it was good advice to put a group photo with girls. I did and I didn't see much difference. I remember a few girls have told me that ""if I see girls in their bio I start to question why they're on Tinder and not banging those girls instead"" which backs up my experience a bit. It probably works for you, but it didn't work for me. Now I only have one group photo of me at my graduation where I'm smiling big with my 2 best friends, the rest are portraits or me doing stuff solo. 

**10. Tinder Plus is worth it if you travel a lot, it's not if you don't.** I got Tinder Plus when I first tried it out to see if it worked. Granted, I was at home and my bio wasn't as good as it is now so I didn't see a difference. But if I'm in a city for only a few days/weeks I don't want to let the swipe limit stop me from matching with somebody I could have matched with if I had been there longer, and for $.33 a day I've made a lot worse purchases, especially since I'm a semi-active Tinderer. 

**11. Beefing it up a little to get your beef in doesn't hurt.** I feel it's imperative for a 5'11 guy to say 6' on Tinder and every girl has told me ""6' sounds soo much cooler than 5'11"". Usually I hate lying in any sense but who cares, especially if you really are 6' with shoes, or really can throw that perfect spiral if it's not windy, or have a 6 pack and V but only in the right lighting with the contrast up, or really did touch a tiger even if it was sedated. When everybody is beefing it up, nobody is.

**12. Dogs are better than cats(on Tinder only)** I love my cat but besides mostly a few weird girls I haven't had many say it was a plus, probably because cats are associated with weird, anti-social people. So rent a dog or steal one. 

**13. Snapchat if you're not sure if she's fat or not, and look at the hands.** Fat people have fat hands. One time I got catfished with a girl who weighed 250 lbs but looked 135 in all her photos, probably because she only showed face, knew how to contour with her makeup, and used old pics. Safe it say it was one of the worst experiences of my life, thankfully we got high and I let her give me a charity hand job(Like I said, I'm picky with who I put my dick in and don't want to bring my average way down) but I still feel some shame sometimes when I think about it. My face must have looked terrified the entire time because she kept asking if I was ok. Decent hand job though I've had worse. On the other hand, this super cute girl seemed chubby over snapchat but in person she was 120 lbs and super petite at 5'2, she just had cute chubby cheeks. So look at the hands. I'm sorry if I sound shallow and offend you in advance, but I'm putting this less so because I am not attracted to fat people, but because I felt incredibly deceived and I don't want it to happen to you either.

**14. Don't listen to that OKCupid article, smile more.** It's so easy to look more like a serial killer than a stoic, dapper, gentleman when you don't smile. You have to have the right angle, editing skills, equipment, and context so you don't come off as emotionless robot that probably wears his matches skin to bed. I'm being a little dramatic but my point is that smiling is a universal human emotion and it's easier to do than the stoic ones. I personally don't smile a lot because a) I'm a naturally serious, down to earth person b)a lot of my photos have me doing stuff, why the fuck would I be smiling I'm trying to play this solo at 140 bpm c)I have crooked ass teeth. I'm not hiding them though because no one has had issues with them except for i) me ii) dental students plus you can tell they're a tad askew in the smiling pic anyway and I don't wanna catfish anyone. Or at least do a smolder or a smirk, whatever just look good I guess.

**15. Don't take Tinder too seriously.** Put the work in but it's just an app. I have an addictive personality and there was definitely a time where I would be swiping all day long to see who I'd match with and my inner Computer Scientist was trying to optimize every possible detail and it just drove me crazy. I even remember one time I messaged a girl of how much dopamine swiping gave me because we were having a random, stream of consciousness conversation and she immediately stopped responding. Keep in mind this was shortly after saying that I had the best opener she'd ever heard and that she swiped right because I was cute. I'm much more laid-back now and the whole experience is more fun.

**16. Don't forget about girls in the real world** Like I said, I'm decent looking and have done well for myself, but right now I need to work on my inner game and self esteem issues so even now keeping eye contact with a cute girl at the mall is a challenge. For now Tinder is practice for interacting with girls in the real world and is great for that. I guarantee me or you could do better than we do on Tinder if we mustered up the courage to pick up girls IRL. 

**Going forward** I'm cutting to lower my body fat and add some sex appeal to the tinder bio with abs. I want to rent a better camera to take better pictures. Maybe it's my editing skills or my photography skills but my current pictures are great but have a very ""my first DSLR"" vibe with the $100 nifty fifty prime lens so I want to rent better equipment to take better pictures and more portraits and action shots. 

**Wrap-up** I want to write a lot more but if I do this post will turn into a full on r/seduction post or a preachy life lesson. I've always been a ""I'll learn it myself guy"" when it comes to things so I don't actively go on seduction forums but the stuff I learn on my own is stuff they're teaching so they're definitely right and will save you time. A lot of this stuff is reiteration from other Tinder self posts but I feel this is a good aggregate of everything. I'll probably edit it more as I think about it.

11,How my Tinder Date Ended With Broken Bones and Police Being Called,168,44,16/11/2015,"I have been using Tinder for around a year and a half. The app has created memories that will stay with me for life. It has enabled me to meet some great girls, some interesting girls and the girl from my most recent date, who is in a league of her own. As I write this, I am still in disbelief about how this date went and I sit here wondering if I have had one of the worst dates of all time. 

The night started off the same way that any normal date would go. We met up at a local bar to grab a beer and get to know each other. We ordered our first beer and everything seemed to be fine. Then, she ordered a shot of whisky. That first shot turned into a second shot, then a third, fourth and a fifth. We walked to another bar and I assumed she would simply order a beer and calm down a bit. Nope, more and more shots were being ordered. This girl was drinking like a camel at a watering hole. She was getting completely obliterated. I was very concerned about how she would get home safely, but she kept assuring me that she had someone who was picking her up. It is now getting pretty late and I wanted to go home. The only problem was, this person giving her a ride never showed up. I told her that it looked like nobody was coming, so we need to find you another way home. She laughs and tells me that she is driving home. Of course I said hell no to that and explained to her that she has four options: 1. I take her home 2. I call a taxi or Uber 3. I call one of her friends 4. I call the police. Once again, she laughs and says she is driving home. After a bit of bickering back and forth, I went and got the bartender for help. The bartender tried to help me talk some sense into her and she seemed to be going along with what we were saying. She even agreed to let me call a taxi for her. I was relieved that the problem seemed to be solved and progress was being made. I reached down for my phone to call the taxi. As I looked down at the screen, I heard her scoot her chair back and then looked up to see my date running as fast as her high heels would take her out of the bar. I then leapt up and ran after her. I was in hot pursuit and gaining on her quickly. The people watching must have thought I was a creep trying to assault some poor girl. Fortunately, drunk girls in heels do not run at gazelle like speed. I caught up and put my arms around her to hold her in one place. I took out my phone and immediately called 911. As we were sitting there waiting for the cops, she tried to make out with me. As you do while waiting for cops to show up. 

The officers came up and explained that they did not want to get her in any trouble. They simply asked her to get in the car with me and let me take her home. She agreed and walked to my car with me. We got in and drove with her crying in the passenger seat and giving me directions. The directions she was giving me did not seem to make sense. We were going away from the direction that she said she lived in. I decided to keep going with her directions and figured everything would be ok. I thought the action was over for the night. Nope. She decided to jump out of my car while it was moving. She took a nasty fall but got up and booked it to start round two of “Chase the Drunk Girl.” I went and grabbed her and laid her on the ground with me staying on top of her to keep her in place. I got out my phone and called the cops once again. As we were waiting, she started saying that she thought she broke a bone (I won’t say which one because that could give away her identity). The cops showed up then the paramedics to check out the broken bone. It turns out she did break it when she jumped out. Even though this girl had clearly lost, she was still putting up a fight. She refused to give contact info for her parents. She refused to let anybody give her a ride anywhere. She was still trying to get up and walk to her car to drive home. You do have to admire the determination.

The date ended with her parents coming to pick her up to go to the hospital and me going home with a story of a lifetime. Thanks Tinder.

I spent over two weeks reporting someone catfishing people on tinder using my pictures and entire identity. My friend (she lives in a different city, mind you) told me about him. Keep in mind this catfish is verified. He's not a harmless catfish either, he was pretty aggressive in asking my friend out after she tried to humor him. She reported, tinder did nothing. Then I reported, they asked me to make an account and verify (no idea why). I did that and tried to contact using every single medium available. Today, well, they banned my account that they asked me to create. The catfish is still out there matching and scamming people. I am expressionless - rapidly flicking the switch between anger and comedy. This app is a fuckfest of scammers and people who enable them.

13,Tinder Plus - Two week review from a sub average/average guy,165,48,05/03/2017,"Hey y'all.

I am a regular joe shmo who decided to give Tinder Plus a try, to see if it was worth the 9.99 a month for an average or sub average guy like me. I'm posting my review here to maybe help anyone else who may be on the fence and in a similar situation. 

Some background:

I live outside Washington D.C. and I found myself single for the first time in over three years after a long term relationship ended in early November 2016. I jumped into Tinder in December because I was looking to date again, obviously. 

I got about a match a day from non-bot accounts initially, only a handful of which resulted in dates, and no hookups as a direct result of Tinder. I got tired of swiping limits and the relentless amount of bot accounts, so fast forward to two weeks ago, I paid for Tinder Plus to try to increase my odds.

There are a couple of points I'm going to touch on in the rest of this post: so here's a brief TL:DR 

1. Fake accounts
2. Location issues
3. Super likes/boosts
4. Being an average/sub-average looking guy
5. Speculation and analysis (so far, not worth it)

First off, here is the link to the Imgur album I'll be referencing for the rest of this post:

https://imgur.com/gallery/wQAHy

1. Fake accounts

So, after paying for Tinder Plus and getting unlimited swipes, I began to notice certain trends amount fake accounts. Most notably and easiest to spot are what I call ""model accounts"".

These accounts share undeniable similarities, and are extremely prolific, about 1 in 4 by my estimate. It's easier to list the similarities rather than put them into a sentence:

- Four photos, all taken from a non-selfie perspective
- Suspiciously high quality ""model"" type photos
- Listed as a student, in a university
- No bio
- 8-12 miles from my location
- Only matched with them when I used my monthly boost
- never tried to send me to Kik, Snapchat, or chat.me, and never tried to ""scam"" me 

When I did match with these accounts, they messaged me right away with varying forms of ""hey, what's up cutie?"" And proved themselves to be bots when replying with continuing and non-sensical messages. 

You can see three examples I screen capped just this morning in my Imgur post. I do not have screenshots of the conversations, as I only matched with these kind of accounts when my boost was live, two weeks ago on a Saturday night. I promptly unmatched and reported them as spam.

My tinfoil theory is that these accounts are owned and operated by Tinder, meant to pad the accounts you see, and make you feel as though you get as much traction out of a boost as possible. 

Besides these fake accounts, there are of course the numerous fake accounts that attempt to redirect you to Snapchat and Kik. Or the scam accounts that are most definitely a real person, but try to send you to chat.me which is a credit card scam video chat site, or something similar.

Some things I noticed to watch for are phrases like:

""I'm never on this app so Kik me at *********""

""I never check messages so Snapchat me at *****""

2. Location issues

This is something honestly I've only had an issue with since joining Tinder Plus, and it's an odd one. I have my location set to my current location at all times and have never used the passport feature. However, I seem to have an endless supply of accounts that are listed in cities like Chicago, St. Louis, New York City, but are only 15-25 miles away. I have never once matched with any account listed this way, as they do seem to be real people.

Prior to joining Tinder Plus I don't recall this, but I estimate about 1 in 6 accounts I come across has this commonality. I  match about 1, non-bot, person every 2-3 days now, and so far none of my matches has been an account like this. 

These could be women using passport I suppose, but it seems very common, whereas the majority of Tinder users don't pay for Tinder Plus, and I'd imagine female users even less so. 

3. Super likes and boosts

For those of you that don't know from the numerous advertisements, Tinder Plus gives you 5 daily Super Likes, and 1 monthly boost. 

I paid for Tinder Plus on Friday, February 17th, and used my monthly boost that weekend, Saturday the 18th.

I found that most tinder users are active Friday and Saturday nights at 9pm, after reading a few unconfirmed articles with little to no evidence supporting. Whatever, it sounded good enough. 

So at 9:03pm I used a boost, and was instructed to swipe as much as possible in my 30 minutes to increase my visibility. So I began ""suicide swiping"", for science, and I was given a circular meter at the bottom of the screen which had some kind of multiplier? It started at 6.3x and by the time my 30 minutes were up it ended at 8.2x. I suppose this was how many times more my profile was seen, but was never given a direct explanation to the purpose or meaning of the multiplier. Afterwards it displayed my final number and went away. 

During my boost, the only accounts that I swiped on and matched right away were the fake accounts from earlier in the post. 24 hours later, fake accounts and all I had 12 matches, only 4 of which were actual people. 6 were the fake profiles, 4 were real, and 2 were scammers. 

Overall I was underwhelmed by the boost feature. 1 of the 4 actual people I matched with during it resulted in a few drinks and nothing more.

On to super likes.

Super likes are how I gauge my ""done for the day"" feeling now, since I have unlimited swipes. When I run out of my 5 a day, I wait until the following day to swipe again. 

I like the super like feature quite a bit, but seemingly don't have much luck with it. It leaves me much more inclined to read profiles and look at all pictures. However, I've only had two girls match me that I super liked over a two week period of using all five, every day. I honestly get more matches out of swiping normally. 

Perhaps a little bit nit-picky, but I don't like that the super likes only recharge after your last one is gone. I Tinder at work, as I am today, and I work retail. If I stop in the middle of using my super likes and forget to use them all over like a 2 hour span, it's only 24 hours after I've used my last one for the day that they will be available again.

4. Step one: be attractive, step two: don't be unattractive.

Now I recommend everyone take this post and my results with a grain of salt. I recognize that I am sub average, average at best. But that's who I'm making this post for. 

The guy in the Imgur album is me, if that wasn't super apparent.

I'm overweight, my style certainly isn't for everyone and I don't make a lot of money. I do believe I'm charming and confident, and a 100% better of an experience in-person. Online dating is a bit of hurdle for me and guys in my league, and I was strictly curious if Tinder Plus would significantly improve my odds. Which brings me to the wrap up.

5. Speculation and Analysis

I don't think Tinder Plus is for me, or guys in a similar situation and here's why.

I think Tinder Plus is a bit of a scam in and of itself. Some of the things I've noticed such as the fake accounts and odd location settings seem awfully fishy to me. I was completely underwhelmed by the boost feature, it felt totally wasted 24 hours later. It's an over marketed and over priced feature at best. I still get advertisements for them shoved down my throat as a Plus user, but I suppose that's the ""whale"" mentality of app-spending consumer marketing.

The super likes are cool and incentive to actually read profiles, but haven't resulted in very many matches for me. I should add that I don't use them on supermodel 10/10 profiles, and I use them what I'd consider to be reasonably. 

Tinder Plus is probably better suited for guys who get plenty of matches and conversations, who want more. A sort of ""win more"" situation. In other words, 8.2 x 0 is still 0. You'll only get more out of Tinder Plus if you're already getting something significant out of Tinder. 

I plan on paying for Tinder Plus for no more than three months, if I don't see a huge difference between now and then. If there is interest, I can make follow up posts about it.

Otherwise I will answer any questions, I'm sure I missed some things and glossed over others.

14,I have been to my 35th Tinder date.,164,246,25/06/2015,"my suggestions during swipes and dates: 

&nbsp;
  
•if she has no photos showing her complete body, she is fat. 

&nbsp;
  
•if you are not sure if she is fat or not, she is fat. 

&nbsp;
  
•most girls takes hundred of photos and upload them but every once in a while you will see some girls dont know how to take good pictures or they just dont care... there were two times I was really surprised how she turned out to be way better looking then her pictures, this usually happens the other way around. During my conversation with them I found that , they are not attention seeking girls and usually introverts. So if you know she might be a cool girl, just give it a shot.

&nbsp;
  

•some girls go to two dates in the same day or night, when she feels like first guy is not what she is looking for, she just jump into bed with the second guy, dont be the first guy. I have had couple of girls admitting they were on the date before they are meeting up with me, the first guy buys drinks and dinner and warmed her up and I get the reward. 

&nbsp;
  
•when a girl implies that she is broke, use caution to before you buy drinks or food, you dont have to pay for anything. I met couple of girls in a pretty bad financial shape who just go out to dates to make guys pay for their food and booze. So I would look for hints, if she admits that next couple of days she will be going to dates, just get up , pay only your part of the check and leave, you deserve better.....

&nbsp;
  
•always choose a public place to meet up with a girl, somewhere with security cameras, even if she is dtf, just meet up somewhere close to you... luckily only one of my dates turned out little bit crazy so far and I am glad I didnt invite her back to my place. most of the girls are good though, that one was an exception.

•I personally choose night time to meet up with girls, I think sexual tension is higher during the night. A cool spot would be somewhere in a short walking or driving distance, somewhere not incredibly loud or crowded but also has attractive people in it. Make sure she doesnt get wasted though, usually about two drink in 1-2 hours is enough to invite her back. if she is interested she will comply. 

&nbsp;
  
•I usually set my dates in week days to keep weekends to myself some girls will say they need to wake up early in the morning so they cant stay long, almost all the girls say that, just ignore it or say that you also wake up early for work, it is just a standard defense mechanism, if they really like you they will make the sacrifice off sleeping little bit less just for one day. 

&nbsp;
  

Out of this 35th dates I have slept about 15 of them. There is only couple of girls I wanted to see later again. There were about 10 girls didnt want to sleep with me same night and either wanted to have a second date or third date. 

&nbsp;
  
I walked out on 3 girls during the date, one had hickies on her neck who admitted that she slept with 7 guys in 10 days and it made me feel terrible, the other one were just a broke girl who was trying to use me, the third one was kinda catfish she put pictures from 4-5 years earlier and 60-70 lbs lighter in that pics. 

&nbsp;
  
There was a girl who was engaged, and she told me that after we slept, I felt sorry for the guy.

16,How tinder ruined my entire life.,94,27,02/12/2021," Hello! I just made this account to keep myself anonymous and talk about my experience of how tinder completely ruined my life. I'm 19 and a international student in the UK.

I've had a tinder date about a month ago, in which she agreed to come into my place and sleep over here, we had sex, we ate something together, she slept here and the next day I took her to the train station. To my surprise on week after that, I get arrested at home and taken to the police station while I was coming home back from work. At first I was completely convinced something had went on to which I was being blamed for mistakenly, something I had no idea of. Until I arrived at the police station I was in shock, scared as I've never been and almost in tears. When I arrived there, they told me what I was being accused of: rape of a girl above 18. The girl I had sex with that week. She blocked me everywhere after I left her on the station, which to me seems like typical girl behavior, didn't give a f about it.

Needless to say, I had to stay on a coldish cell for more than 40 hours. I did an interview in which I discussed my side of the story and ended up being released under investigation, to which no one has contacted me about anything yet. They siezed my clothing and my phone, I had to buy a new one, because I'm a student from outside and everything I need to live my life is on my phone. For that reason, I've been struggling to get enough money to eat properly. (I lived off my own savings and some monthly of my parents, which earn too little to give me that much money, they are outside the UK.)

Nowadays, my life is complete shit. I can't stand talking to anyone in person, I tried to a ton of times, for some reason I start feeling uncomfortable, I stopped going out because if I drink it gets even worse and I will just break down, I stopped talking to other people and can barely have any will to answer the messages people send me, I stopped working because I couldn't really be around people without feeling bad. My life has been ruined for something I didn't even do, I can't even imagine talking to another girl after this. I constantly feel numb or completely depressed, and to be honest, scared due to how this things never go to the guys side, even if he's done nothing.

I hope none of you ever has to go through this, I needed to share this with someone else.",sexual assault,hello made account keep anonymous talk experience tinder completely ruined life i m international student uk i ve tinder date month ago agreed come place sleep here sex ate something together slept next day took train station surprise week that get arrested home taken police station coming home back work first completely convinced something went blamed mistakenly something idea of arrived police station shock scared i ve never almost tears arrived there told accused of rape girl girl sex week blocked everywhere left station seems like typical girl behavior give f it needless say stay coldish cell hours interview discussed side story ended released investigation one contacted anything yet siezed clothing phone buy new one i m student outside everything need live life phone reason i ve struggling get enough money eat properly i lived savings monthly parents earn little give much money outside uk nowadays life complete shit can t stand talking anyone person tried ton times reason start feeling uncomfortable stopped going drink gets even worse break down stopped talking people barely answer messages people send me stopped working really around people without feeling bad life ruined something even do can t even imagine talking another girl this constantly feel numb completely depressed honest scared due things never go guys side even he s done nothing hope none ever go this needed share someone else,tinder ruined entire life
17,I FINALLY had my first Tinder “hookup” last night,82,81,14/02/2021,"It has been a long time coming (no pun intended) but after many failed attempts at finding a FWB on Tinder I believe my search paid off. We talked for a few days. I was able to do some internet sleuthing on him. He’s a well established personal trainer in the area so I was pretty sure he wasn’t a Ted Bundy. 

I ended up being spontaneous and going to his place which was like 15min from mine. Apart from it being a total bachelor pad it was pretty nice. We sat and talked for about 45 minutes and then he grabbed my hand and it was ON. He was super sexy. Did NOT catfish me in the least, which was a plus lol 

The hookup was pretty good - he wasn’t the greatest but he was PACKING so it could have been worse for sure lol. Also want to just add here: 

MEN PLEASE START MAKING NOISE IN BED. WHEN IM WORKING IT ON TOP AND YOU JUST LAY THERE PLAYING WITH MY BOOBS I HAVE NO IDEA IF IM DOING GOOD OR NOT. Plus it’s hot when guys make noise.

18,"Has anyone encountered ""massage therapists"" on here?",75,150,05/05/2020,"I really wish I had taken a screenshot of her profile but I didn't think of it at the time. C'est la vie...

Basically trying to figure out if this was a scam (I'm 95% sure it was). Came across a profile of a very attractive woman in my area offering massage services (yeah, yeah, I know what you're thinking, but seriously my neck has been in knots lately) so I added her on snap (which is how she said to contact her). This was weird but I also figured not entirely out of the realm of believability. She messaged me right away offering pricing that was very reasonable (almost too reasonable, but again, someone operating out of their house wouldn't have terribly high overhead), told me payment would be in cash but said I had to book through a web portal so she had all my information.

Here's where most of the red flags came up. While the website itself didn't look scammy, it did require a credit card prior to booking (remember, she said payment would be in cash). Also, the site kept referring to ""our therapists"" without giving any sort of location info, or way to verify that it was specifically her (no identifiable photos or location marker). I tried googling it and unlike a service like SOOTH there was nothing else. Literally nothing (furthermore, upon review there are MANY similarities in the design of Sooth's website and this one). I inquired about why I had to provide a credit card first and she said it was because she's had violent clients before and was once almost ""gang raped,"" so she needed to protect herself against that. I asked the woman for further identification and she sent me an instagram with six photos on it (all since January) and then asked me to book her now. I still balked and asked if there was any other way to verify and she shut the conversation down.

Like I said, I am very sure this was a scam but has anyone else encountered something like this? I tried to do some research on massage scams on Tinder and didn't find much so maybe these are just starting? Would love to know for the future and also as a warning to everyone else on here. Thanks.

19,I’m surprised I’m alive,75,7,23/01/2020,"Here is my tinder horror story. So at the time I was a 19yr female and a junior in college. My boyfriend at the time and I broke up and I wanted to see what tinder was like. All my sorority sisters hyped it up and I thought it would be fun.. but I was sadly mistaken. I won’t lie I have a thing for men in uniform. I find it super hot and manly, so when I saw this guy on tinder in a navy uniform I immediately without hesitation swiped right. We matched and were chatting some. A couple days later after some causal flirting and the usual game of 20 questions that scratch the surface of getting to know someone he asks me on a date. I didn’t think anything of it and said yes. I was really exciting to be getting back out there after my break up. The next day he picked me up in his tricked out Honda and I won’t lie that was the first red flag for me. It kinda looked like the f*ckboy mobile, but I shrugged it off and got in the car. He looked just like his picture which put me at ease. I was so worried he would catfish me after hear stories from my friends! So then we start chatting some as he drives us to the restaurant. As were chatting I begin to ask him about to navy. He got obviously nervous. Kinda stuttered almost as he answered questions. My dad was in the navy so I know my way around the different jobs and terminology, so I decided to ask some detailed questions about what he specifically does. As he answered more and more of my questions I figured out he was lying. Most of what he was saying wasn’t making sense. That was red flag 2. After that I started to get a little uneasy.. thinking to myself if he lied about being in the Navy what else is he lying about... He then thought he would try and impress me to get my mind off him obviously lying to me and went into telling me he was a Navy cop who would go back and forth from the naval academy... I decided to go along with it because I already knew this would be our last date as I didn’t trust him anymore. I then proceeded to say “oh really tell me more” as I gazed out the window wishing I never got in the car. He could tell I was becoming disinterested. We then came to a stop light and he leaned over and sorta whispered “you know I have about 3 guns in my trunk for my cop duties”. I was alarmed. It was such a weird comment that came out of no where and the tone of his voice was scary. It wasn’t like how he had been talking but more sinister. I then started to panic a little. I’ve watched way too much investigation discovery to know that this can turn ugly quick. I pulled my phone out and quickly sent a text telling my friend “it’s not going well, I’m going to try and leave”. A couple minutes pass and we’re sitting in the car in complete silence. We’re on the highway at this point and there was a small wooded area that separated the roads. He breaks the silence with “hey you see those woods right there” I say “yes what about them” then he says with no expression on his face starting blankly at the road “that would be the perfect place to hide a dead body don’t you think, no one would ever think to look for someone there”. I froze. This is the part where the narrator on ID would say “she never made it out of the car alive” or something like that. I mustered up enough courage to say “I want to go home”. He said “but we haven’t even gotten to the restaurant yet” and I said “I don’t care take me home or I’m calling the police”. He seemed shocked like my reaction was out of left field or something.. as if he wasn’t scaring the living hell out of me.. he kept driving staring blankly at the road. So I took my phone out and dialed 911. He finally realized I was serious and started turning around and driving me back to my place. The rest of the ride was in silence. I always wonder what he would have done to me if I never pestered him about the Navy and we ended up going to the restaurant... if that’s where he was actually taking me...",catfish,tinder horror story time yr female junior college boyfriend time broke wanted see tinder like sorority sisters hyped thought would fun sadly mistaken wont lie thing men uniform find super hot manly saw guy tinder navy uniform immediately without hesitation swiped right matched chatting some couple days later causal flirting usual game questions scratch surface getting know someone asks date didnt think anything said yes really exciting getting back break up next day picked tricked hon the wont lie first red flag me kin the looked like f ckboy mobile shrugged got car looked like picture put ease worried would catfish hear stories friends start chatting drives us restaurant chatting begin ask navy got obviously nervous kin the stuttered almost answered questions dad navy know way around different jobs terminology decided ask detailed questions specifically does answered questions figured lying saying wasnt making sense red flag started get little uneasy thinking lied navy else lying about thought would try impress get mind obviously lying went telling navy cop would go back forth naval academy decided go along already knew would last date didnt trust anymore proceeded say oh really tell gazed window wishing never got car could tell becoming disinterested came stop light leaned sorta whispered know guns trunk cop duties alarmed weird comment came tone voice scary wasnt like talking sinister started panic little ive watched way much investigation discovery know turn ugly quick pulled phone quickly sent text telling friend going well i am going try leave couple minutes pass sitting car complete silence highway point small wooded area separated roads breaks silence hey see woods right say yes says expression face starting blankly road would perfect place hide dead body dont think one would ever think look someone there froze part narrator id would say never made car alive something like that mustered enough courage say want go home said havent even gotten restaurant yet said dont care take home i am calling police seemed shocked like reaction left field something wasnt scaring living hell me kept driving staring blankly road took phone dialed finally realized serious started turning around driving back place rest ride silence always wonder would done never pestered navy ended going restaurant thats actually taking me,im surprised i am alive
20,A Story that has never left me (trigger warnings),74,8,12/08/2020,"So I am a 33 year old woman. I've been married for a year, dated my now husband for two before that and we met on Tinder. Before I met him I was in a very long term relationship (around 8 years) with a guy who ended up cheating on me. I found out about the cheating (we were living together, I saw texts while he was in the shower), we broke up and I went a little nuts on Tinder for awhile. I lived in a big city at the time so it was easy to go on 2 or 3 dates a week. I was also partying quite a bit at the time. My ex and I were into raving and some extracurricular substances and I would routinely do that with guys I had never met. Not my proudest moments but I wasn't in the best state of mind at the time.

Anyways, one guy in particular I met out for a drink one day. He took one look at me and asked if I was high. I wasn't at all and asked why he thought that. He didn't have an answer and was kind of weird and standoffish the whole ""date"". For the record... I am pretty conventional looking, small blonde chick. Nothing about me says ""drug user"" or ""shows up places high"". Anyways, didn't think much of him again until about a week later, he asked if I would come play tennis with him. I said sure, we met at a tennis court overlooking the city and actually had a great time. Went back to his apartment after, had some drinks and ended up doing some cocaine with his roommate. I slept there but didn't have sex with him. I had a horrible hangover the next day and didn't really remember liking him that much so decided to write it off. A few days later he texted me out of the blue asking if I wanted to go skiing. We live around 4 hours from the snow so it would have been an overnight trip. I love skiing and remember him telling me about a sick house his family owned near the ski resorts but something told me to say no. I declined but said maybe we could meet up for a drink. He accused me of being scared to go away with him alone. I laughed it off and met up with him anyway. 

Met up for a drink and he was acting kind of weird. Very shifty and looking at his phone a lot. Then out of the blue said he'd been with a prostitute earlier that day and what did I think about that? I thought he was kidding (again, I wasn't in the best state of mind during this time... now I would NEVER give someone like this the time of day!!). He kept checking his phone, I finally asked him what was up and he said one of the prostitutes he was with stole a bunch of cocaine from him and was trying to get in touch with his regular dealer. I said I didn't need any drugs. He left the bar for about 20 minutes to take a phone call and I SAT THERE WAITING (?!!!) Comes back, asks me to come back to his place. For some reason I agreed. 

We get back and he immediately locks the door and started pushing me up against his kitchen island, dropping his pants the floor. He said his roommate wasn't home and we should have sex in his kitchen. I was honestly getting really uncomfortable by this point but my brain wouldn't let me believe it. I had been in a relationship for so long before all of this that I honestly didn't know what dating really was. I didn't want to believe I was a girl that a guy would take advantage of because I had always been someone with a boyfriend that no one could touch. 

Anyways, we started having sex, I was naked sitting on his island thing and he CALLS HIS ROOMMATE out of his room to watch. He said something disgusting like ""Look how hot this little one is"" and told the guy to stand there and watch. I was mortified and didn't know what to do. I said I had to go to the bathroom and got down and went and locked the door. His room was connected to the bathroom and I had to walk thru his closet to get there. As I walked by his shelves I saw some framed photos kind of shoved to the side and a handmade birthday card that said ""Daddy"". The dude had a very young daughter and he was treating women like this, while pushing all evidence of her into a closet when he had people over. 

I was really freaked out and didn't feel comfortable leaving right away. He lived in a very hard to get out of high rise apartment building and I was afraid of him following me. I was also afraid to wait for an Uber alone so I went back out and hung out with him for a bit, pretending to drink, waiting for him to get fucked up himself and pass out. He finally did and I snuck away around 5 AM. I had no coat, it was freezing outside and it was a sketchy area to wait for an Uber but I didn't care, I needed to get out of there. I pretty much blocked it out of my mind after that and didn't text him at all.

A couple weeks later, out of the blue, he texted me asking if I wanted to go see the Super Bloom with him. It would have been again a 3 or 4 hour drive somewhere and a night alone. It gave me such a creepy feeling that he would even ask me to do something like that. Like all my alarms started flashing and I had the craziest feeling that he thought he could get away with killing me. I said no thank you and left it at that. A few days later he texted me a picture of a female mutual friend he must have seen on my facebook (we were not friends so he must have just stalked my list). He said you know this girl? She's one of my favorite whores and her p\*ssy smells like f\*sh. Yours was so much cleaner. I was SO disgusted, I deleted the text, blocked his number and what I thought were his social media profiles. I felt so gross about the whole encounter but kept treking forward (and thank God...I met my husband a few months later :) ) 

Anyways, a few months went by and Instagram flashed me a profile for someone I might know. I thought it looked like this guy so I clicked. I knew he had the daughter and I figured it was from a previous relationship and he was just a (disgusting) single dad. Umm no. He had a full FAMILY the entire time. An extremely plain, innocent looking wife, a daughter and another kid on the way. They lived in a house in a town about an hour and a half from the hi rise city apartment he met me in. There was no roommate, I to this day have no idea who the person was who watched him pretty much rape me on his kitchen island. 

I've never told anyone this entire story... friends have heard bits and pieces but not the entire creep factor. Even though he was not violent or ever threatened me at all, I strongly believe I escaped something really bad happening to me by cutting off contact. I feel like he was working up to physically hurt me in some way.

I think about his wife from time to time and look at her social media. From the outside, she has no idea what kind of person she's with but who knows what happens behind closed doors. Not sure why I was thinking about this today as it all happened several years ago but I think I needed to get it off my chest.

21,My tinder night from hell....you need to read this,63,31,19/11/2014,"Hello everyone!
So for my first ever Reddit post I have decided to share with ya'll my tinder story! I wrote this last year, moments after it happened and formatted it as a blog post of sorts for my friends to read. Enjoy!


Last night, at approximately 1230am, while half asleep, I heard my phone buzz. Curious as to who could be contacting me at such an hour, I rolled over and clicked on my phone and saw the notification read “New Tinder Message.” I’m always interested to see what’s new in the world of tinder, so I opened the app to this message- “Fuck tonight in Lakeview for fun? Or does that make me sound slutty?” Confused, taken aback and just flat out flabbergasted I responded with “Don’t think that make you “slutty,” and it would be fun for us both, but you’re not serious….” She then replied back saying that she is “serious,” and “horny.” She begged me not to “tease” her and asked if I had a “shower and weed” (she was very adamant about those two things). She then messaged me her number and asked me for my address. I am at first hesitant, thinking that sending her my address would result in me getting robbed, raped or axe murdered. However, seeing as that I haven’t been laid in awhile, I decide to let the situation play out and text her my address. 

I got a response immediately; “I am coming!” I was exceptionally nervous, again thinking along the lines of this being some sort of set up. I was then asked to send a selife and a “dick pick,” both of which I was incredibly reluctant to forward to this individual. She then begins to forward me gifs of people having sex. Around 10 minutes into texting, this girl tells me that she is almost there, and that I should come outside. I stayed in my apartment, gazing out the window, still in disbelief that this entire situation was even taking place. I got a message saying to look for a girl in a green car. Low and behold, a green car pulled up in front of my building, and inside of the car was a girl. I walked outside and this girl immediately jumped out of her car and ran in my direction. This girl is tall (like six-foot, so much taller than myself at 5'8""), average in terms of physical appearance (like most of us) and, to my surprise, stone cold sober. Once she was within arms reach, she threw herself against my body and began to make out with me in the middle of the street. 

I’ve got to be honest here folks; I was not really into this. Who would be? Having a stranger stick their tongue into your mouth the moment you first make eye contact would make even the horniest of men cringe. In spite of this, I still preceded to try and get laid, and after she pulled back I led her up into my apartment. We stepped into to my room and she immediately closed the door and began to take her clothes off. This girl, now completely naked, threw me onto my bed and climbed on top of me, riding over my crotch with her bare cooch. Again, I was not really into this and was having quite a bit of trouble getting hard. Some time passes and then suddenly this girl stops, says “this is weird,” gets off my bed, puts on her clothes, runs (literally) out my front door , into her car and drives away.

23,"Catfished by an air gun slinging, 50 shades hating, tinder date",61,15,18/02/2015,"I have met up with girls from Tinder who looked a lot different than their pictures but I’ve never had a completely different person show up…except once a few months ago.  And the catfish part was only the beginning.  I had exchanged 15 messages with a girl I will call ‘air guns’ in the matter of a couple days.  I stopped messaging her back to do homework and didn’t think much of it.  Later that night she messaged me asking to come over.  This has happened on Tinder before but I was somewhat suspicious and it seemed too good to be true.  However, she looked like a very cute and innocent Asian girl so my hormones got the best of me and I gave her my address.  I waited impatiently for this mystery girl to show up at 2am in the pouring rain.  It had the makings of a romcom (or a horror movie).  She messaged me saying she was downstairs. I went down and I saw a girl with her back to me and she was pointing up in the sky.  She wasn’t just pointing, she was counting.  Weird, but maybe she’s an astrologist.  I cautiously opened the door and she turned around but it wasn’t the girl I had messaged.  I just stood there staring at her thinking it must just be a coincidence.  She stopped pointing at the sky but now her hands were pointing at me and in the shape of guns and she looked me dead in the eye and went “pew pew, Jordan?”  I didn’t know if I was more confused about her pretending to shoot me or the fact that it was not the same girl from the profile but then it hit me, I had been ‘catfished’.  They didn’t look alike and I don’t mean their hair color or facial features, I mean the girl in the pictures was Asian and this girl was 100% Caucasian.  And she had facial piercings and tattoos.  It was a completely different girl.  So I did the only sane thing to do when you have a potential psychopath at your door, I let her in.  The funny thing is that she was actually pretty cute so I was excited but terrified. In the elevator she started counting out loud and I was convinced she was on drugs so I asked her.  She looked at me and casually said “No, I don’t even drink, pew pew.”   She had already shot me twice and we hadn’t even made it to my room.  I introduced her to my roommate and she put her hands up and shot him as well.  I figured since this was a planned hook up, that we would get right down to business but as soon as we got into my room she went on a rant about the cab driver. And not just any rant, she went on to tell me that all cab drivers were out to kill her and 4 that she knows of have actually tried. She showed me a scar from a cab driver who apparently tried to run her over.  She told me she couldnt figure out why they were trying to kill her.  Before I had time to make sense of her conspiracy theory or the night in general, she jumped on me and we started hooking up just like that.  I forgot about the weirdness and was actually enjoying myself…until she mentioned being into BDSM. OF COURSE ‘air guns’ is into that.  And I jokingly asked, “Like 50 shades of grey?” And her face turned to pure evil. She gave me a death stare and then started yelling at me; telling me that book is the worst thing to ever happen to BDSM and how turned off she is that I mentioned it and I am loser for liking it. She got up, got dressed and shot me one last time.  Despite everything that had just taken place, there was something I needed to know as she finished shooting me for the third time. “How many times have you done that today?” She stood there for a few seconds and said “27” and just like that she was gone.  Unless I ever see a news story about a girl who was murdered by cab drivers, I don’t know if I will ever be able to make sense of ‘air guns’ but I at least got to learn that the BDSM community hates ’50 Shades of Grey;.

So, I'm confident but aware that fat chicks are not attractive to everyone and I have no interest in meeting someone who is not attracted to me. All my pictures are within two months (except the last two, the sepia tone and snow. That was 8-6 months ago. The first picture is most recent, being two weeks old)

Basically, I want to know if my profile crosses the line from confident into cringeworthy. I don't want to come across as the tumblr ""ALL BODIES ARE PERFECT AND IF YOU THINK FATTIES ARE GROSS YOU'RE WRONG."" Alternately, don't want to come across as ""I'm ashamed of myself and have no spine or sense of self value.""

Help? Suggestions?

25,New Tinder Scam at least here in stockholm,54,12,29/11/2016,"I had a few dates with Thai women from Tinder here in Stockholm lately, and between the 2nd and 3rd one i noticed an interesting scam of sorts going on.

Much the same way a street-hawker will guide someone into a store in a tourist area, these women are suggesting a couple of very specific of Thai restaurants for first dates...  These restaurants are nothing special, more like small holes in the wall seeking out a living.

That in and of itself is fine, where it gets weird is;

When you ask for the address, they have taken photos of the store front and will send them to you. The photo was taken in the summertime, in the photo flowers are out and  no snow on everything as it has been here now for a month.

If you ask for a second date, they will suggest the same restaurant.

This isnt all that strange, until;

The first thai woman I met was only interested in eating, no talking, no kissing, no actual date stuff. 

The second thai woman i met, suggested the same restaurant, with the same photo.

That was fine and all until the 2nd date was only interested in eating, no talking, no actual date stuff, just trying to move me in to the table, get my order and get out the door....

This is when it started to click for me, and then a few days later I met yet another thai woman on tinder.  ....and when it came time to plan a date, i got the exact same photo of the exact same restaurant...

so my guess here is these women are not actually interested in dating but earning some extra cash or a meal by hostessing as a date in order to get feet and mouths into these businesses.

not a bad strategy, but, well, I for one wont fall for it, despite having yummy thai food.

26,Tinder Gold is a scam,52,28,07/07/2022,"I purchased Tinder Gold to be able to have unlimited likes. I now get WAY MORE pop up’s (at least 5x, probably closer to 10x) asking me to upgrade for an extra $5/month, buy more boosts, and buy more super likes. 

About 3 days ago I reviewed all 89 likes I’ve received and swiped right on ~10. Only 1 match actually went through.

Now the page that shows me who likes me is totally empty, despite getting a dozen notifications in the last 2 days that I have new likes waiting to be reviewed. I’m making this post after it just happened again. 

Additionally, I am receiving matches as I swipe right on profiles that don’t show that they’ve already liked me. Obviously they did already like me in order for us to match when I swiped right.

27,Weird tinder date....big waste of time,44,28,27/03/2022,"So this “date” lasted maybe 10 minutes if that and I have no idea what happened.

So I’ve been texting this girl this week and we met up today. So I meet her and she’s with her friend I introduce myself ask her friend her name, her friend asks if she’s alright and then leaves with her bf. I ask if she wants to go in and grab drinks and she says she doesn’t like the bar so wants to find something else. The very first thing she asks me is if I like her friend and thinks she’s pretty. I respond She seems cool. She says let’s take down our mask and see who’s the catfish (I joked about her cat fishing) so we did and we agreed welooked like our pics. 

We walk for a bit and I suggest some bars we pass and she has one reason or another she doesn’t want to go into them. She keeps stopping and saying she’s cold. I asked if she wanted me to drop her back off at the bar with her friend thinking maybe she wasn’t into me but she says no. She says she’s sleepy so I ask if she wants to go home and do this another time and she said she wants to find another bar but everything I suggest she says no. This goes on for 10 minutes until she decides she’s just gonna go back to her friends house I say ok I’ll just wait with you until the Uber comes and I’ll get mine. We stand there for a while and she never orders the Uber but asks how much it would be if we got one together. 

Eventually I just left her because I had no idea wtf was going on. I run into her friend and tell her where I left her and she tells me to tell her the Ubers here and I’m like wtf?

29,Got scammed out of $200,42,30,18/06/2021,"So I met this girl named Rachel on tinder, and she told me to add her on Snapchat. We talked for about a day and we both mentioned how we weren’t looking for anything serious and wanted to simply hookup. This morning she sends me a bunch of illicit photos of herself telling me to come over; being a recently broken up man looking for some fun of course I was going to pull up! I drive 50 minutes to her location at an apartment in downtown Atlanta call Ma and get to her room. She reveals that if I want to play, I have to pay. Now I know that usually it’s a scam and not to go along with these types of interactions on social dating apps. But I had $200 to spare and was like “fuck it, let’s have an experience“. I sent her 200 bucks and she said perfect. A few minutes past and I’m still at the door. I’ve knocked probably four times now and have called her phone number and she said “LOL don’t rush me”. I tell her my bad, thing to myself “well maybe she’s in the bathroom taking a shit or something“ and I wait a little bit longer. Then I start to wonder what the fuck is really going on and I ask her if the door is unlocked. She doesn’t respond and I which for the doorhandle and to my surprise the door swings wide-open. I walk into the apartment, nice ass apartment, and it’s completely empty. No food in the cabinets, no food in the cupboards, no clothes in the drawer or dresser, no toothbrush; no mouthwash; and in the washing machine it’s just bedding. I checked the bedroom closet and there’s only an ironing board and two more full bags of bedding. I try and give her a call and text her, I sent her a video of the apartment asking what the fuck was going on, and she replies “um goodnight”.

31,30M assaulted by 33F,42,21,08/12/2020,"Here you go Reddit. Another worst tinder date story. I'll name her WG.

First off, I am 30M. And I've been on lots of tinder date. It might not shock you to hear, I don't have many that end in me sending tinder a ""report"" about someone. Actually, never once did I report a person's profile on tinder until now. And for once, I won't feel a tad bit of sympathy if their profile gets banned.

For my own safety I've screenshot every text we exchanged. 

This was last night.

I'm going to start with we only spoke for a few minutes before agreeing to meet up. I can only invest so much energy into getting to know someone through a device before the connection feels like The Matrix. So I cut the chase after a few exchanges and ask to meet. It doesn't work all the time. But the point is, I don't waste my time.

I took WG to a local dive. It happens to be my current fav. I am a ""regular"" and very well acquainted with other regulars enough to know that if I bring a date, she will be constantly surrounded by people that speak positively of my character. And also a less likelihood of her getting hit on left, and right. Women hate that, right? But she surprisingly felt a need to compensate for the lack of catcalling by being a desperate attention whore. Per usual, there's only a few women present, one that I'm close to, left almost immediately after meeting WG. I think she didn't want to share space with another woman whom was going to play eye candy for the fellas instead of playing pool with the fellas. Seeing her drive out one of my respected female friends was a bit annoying. If not a sign, one that I chose to ignore.

I don't know where this part should be included my first impression that WG was a racist came from the way she treated the staff. The bar is owned and operated by asians of different ethnicities. The bartender has a very thick accent. I've never had the pleasure to be a patron in a bar that was primarily an Asian staff in this city or any other. I think a part of me feels a connection to them being 'different' than what people expect and it makes me more comfortable as a person of color in this particular bar. WG did that thing, where someone is addressing them, but refuses to respond to them directly. The bartender just asked simple questions about what she was ordering, WG kept going ""waaaat"" and looking directly at me, but not giving eye contact to the bartender. I did not like that. But I tried not to draw attention to it, because the bartender has probably as thick of skin as she does an accent.

For some reason WG blurted to the bartender. This is our first date. I thought it was weird and a little embarrassing. No one asked. 

WG felt ignored by me. I felt ignored by her. Ironically, I'm an attention whore too. I don't struggle with making new friends. I actually prefer to meet new friends instead of traveling to outings with friends. So I began to predict the behavior WG was going to exemplify, under the impression that I was not interested in her, as much as I was interested in playing pool and shooting the shit with the fellas (sans the one lady she made wanna leave), was going to be for the purpose of making me jealous.

I've only had two drinks. I typically only have 2 drinks. So I'm coherent and aware of her energy, my energy, and the differences in how we navigate the energies of the other people at the bar that night. WG is more than 2 drinks in. I bought her one. But I could /tell/ she had some few before meeting up. So I'm worried that maybe, this is the worst place for her energy. Because she doesn't need anymore drinks. But she's feigning for attention, and men prey on that shit in the bar scene. And at some point WG is sitting at the bar taking shots with some random group of people. Meanwhile she told me a few moments before she was ""coming right back."" 

Anyway, I greet WG at the bar. Prepared to annihilate all the noise and give her my undivided attention and try to get to know her. And as soon as I say hello, the new friends she made, walked away. Rude. Honestly gave off racists energy. WG enthusiastically tells me she was being hit on. By a woman. The shots were bought by said woman. I stop her. Tell her it was kinda rude they just bailed when your black date came over. WG is thrown for a loop. Because apparently WG REALLY wants to flirt with her. Rude. WG expressed she would never have done it without asking me for permission. To which I say, I can't give it to you because I'm on a date with you. WG doesn't accept. What's the point of asking then, you might say. 

WG then dramatically follows the rude girl who couldn't be bothered to say hi to the black guy she is on a date with. It was extra. Like almost narrating her actions. People aren't sure what to make of it. At some point she yells something offensive. ""You're gay!"" I was trying to hide my face in my palms and just give her 2 minutes to get that girls number, so I don't know the context of that statement. But she yelled it. Another woman confronted her. Full stop. Ready to fight WG. Now I'm walking up. Hey, let's leave. I'm worried she's going to be like, hey don't tell me what to do. But I'm worried if I don't tell her what to do, she's going to start a fight because she's stupid. She's straddling the thin line between ""Girl, you cray"" and ""bitch, you are embarrassing /me/.""

WG refuses to leave. We sit at the bar. WG wants shots. They close in 10 minutes. WG still wants to hang out with that other girl. And then tells me another acquaintance of mine that's there is really hot and she wants to hook up with him too. I'm exhausted. I tell her she's being disrespectful. Although I may not have been the most attentive on this date, I don't deserve to hear this. Because I haven't once said to WG that I'm super attracted to any one other person in the bar to WG's face, then bail and make her watch me flirt with someone else. And I said it is even more fucked up that she primarily wanted to hookup with the one person in the bar that was being extremely rude to me.

WG welcomes my criticism. She says thank you for calling me out. WG says she's been raped so many times. Some random is sitting in the bar stool behind her. Probably waiting for a cue to jump in. I interrupt WG before for she finishes this emotional dump to me and some creepy stranger eavesdropping on us. I again ask her if she would like to leave and talk just the two of us.

This is really long already, and I apologize for all the extra shit I need to add. The night before this happened. There was a shootout on the front step of the bar. One person shot. Several vehicles shot. This isn't a violent prone place. But the city I live in is. Anyway. So the staff is at all time concern for safety, seeing as how the night before two patrons shot at each other at the entrance of the bar. The police are not who bar owners want in there business during covid. I bring this up because the bartender is giving me every cue in the world to get WG out of there. I don't know what WG wants from the night. I don't know if she wants to hookup with that other girl or not. I don't care if she is even thinking of hookup with me. She's unpredictable and I've lost all faith in her ability to socialize without starting a fight. In my favorite bar.

We leave. I have weed in the car. I proceed to roll a blunt. WG postures like she is going to get in the car then goes back in the bar to use the restroom. After awhile I call. WG's been in there a minute and the bar is definitely closed. So I'm hoping WG doesn't think she is entitled to make them stay open as long as it takes for her to get her issue off chasing that random rude girl. She answers the phone. She is cleaning her puke in the bathroom. I tell her, I'm here for her as a friend, please use me as a lifeline. My car is running and the hot air is already on. She says she'll be out there soon.

WG is standing on the corner. In the waiting for an Uber stance. I'm thrown for a loop. Because she hasn't explained she is about to ceremoniously leave despite saying she was going to talk to me before leaving. I shout out the car window, ""why are you being so fucking weird?"" Then she gets in the car. I start to open up. Trying to start a dialogue. Trying to finish rolling that blunt. She says her Uber is too close for her to cancel because she's poor and doesn't want it effecting her rating. But invites me to her apartment to finish our conversation. Sure. I tell her I'll just follow the Uber.

We get to her neighborhood. The Uber stops. The Uber pulls off. Ok maybe wrong address. The Uber stops again. The Uber pulls off. I text WG. Everything ok with your Uber driver? I don't know what's going on she texts back. I ask her to call so I know she's safe. She doesn't. I call her. No answer. There's police cars on the road suddenly and sirens go off. I pull over. The Uber pulls over.

The cops asks me what's going on. I ask him what's going on. He says my car was described as following that other car. I tell him sure, but I don't know what the problem is. I explain I am following my date home to hang out. Being that I was actively texting WG my cell phone was in my head and the text thread was visible to the officer. WG and I took and shared a few pictures together at the bar. So he asked if this is my date in the photo. I said yes. He asked her name. Then excused himself to speak with the driver in the other car.

I hold back the urge to text WG. I already know she's the one that called the cops. But I'm wondering if I'm actually following the wrong car. The officer and a second officer come to my car. Do you have any texts from WG saying come to my apartment?

If you've been reading this and wondering when the hell is it going to say what she did that was so bad. Here it is.

At the officers question, I'm feeling threatened. Not by the officer. But by the implication that is being translated to the officer, that I'm doing something inappropriate. And I have now been put in the position of a he-said, she-said with none more deadly, than a /white girl./ I tell the officer very bluntly, from what it is that's happening I believe the reason you are asking me that question is because WG is in that car denying having ever invited me to her apartment and now you need me to prove it. And he nods his head almost abashedly. Like he can clearly see I have been on a date with her and she's been texting me. But now he has to tell me this fucked up scenario is her way of saying ""nevermind."" The other officer is blunt. When we spoke to her, it didn't take long for us to see she is drunk. I said, well, I know. And that's why I felt it was pretty important to see to it that she got home. I was trying to be a friend, haven't drank much at all, was trying to be on my best behavior and make a good impression. This is really unfair of her, I tell the police, to treat me this way. I find myself saying ""how do you to tell someone that their behavior when they are drunk is unacceptable?"" The cops say, if this is your first time meeting her, and this is what's happening, she is trouble and you need to delete her number. They explain that while they spoke to her she said that the bar I took her to made her feel very uncomfortable (ironic, she was telling dudes to touch her ass, twerking on strangers, accepting blunts that were passed to her, and played three games of pool with me and my acquaintances that were super nice to her) and WG had said it felt like a mafia-atmosphere. The police reassured me that I was not in any trouble and let me go with information of exactly how she purported my character.

Now. Thankfully it's 2020. Because if it was 1920. I would be dead. Unfortunately. It is 2020. Y'all white women have seen BLM in the news and on social media for a good six years. Y'all know exactly the danger people of color face when it comes to being suspected for a crime. Even if, a person hasn't committed a crime, people of color have a higher likelihood of being fatally injured in an interaction with police. And this bitch will expect people to believe she was just drunk tee-hee. 

I don't think that is acceptable. The same as I would not think it is acceptable for a man to sexually assault a woman and then blame it on the alcohol.

I feel assaulted, even though I wasn't beaten. I feel violated, even though I wasn't touched. I won't ever forget this, even though WG is never going to talk about this again.

32,Please learn to recognize red flags.,41,11,13/12/2021,"Roughly two weeks ago at work I came into contact with this woman who was here to meet up with her tinder date. I work for a gated community for security. Immediately I'm thinking date? Its 4 in the morning, who has a date this late/early? Then I was like ah tinder yeah. So I ask her the name of the person she's visiting, she only knew his first name. She proceeds to tell me she wasn't even aware that he lived in a gated community. 

This was very concerning to me because we have over 4,000 acres, and many homes, alongside with that we have a variety of wildlife including cougars, panthers, gators, bears, snakes, and so on. How this works is there's residents and their guests. Anybody living past these gates, knows their guest NEED a pass, NEED to know where they're going. She then told me he said he'd just be walking around. Reminder this is at 4 in the morning, and suddenly he won't return her calls or texts. 

So lets count the flags. 

Didn't give last name.

Didn't let her know this is a gated community

Didn't give her his address 

Arrived when she was supposed to then suddenly starts ghosting her. 

Said he'd be walking around in the middle of the night and that's how she'll find him. 

&#x200B;

I refused to allow her in. I'm no hero for it, but guys you have to see red flags, I know we all get lonely sometimes and we just want to feel something, but we can't just blindly rush into things considering the lack of knowledge we're given about who we're seeing. We have to be smarter. I refused to let her in because as I kept talking with her the same question kept repeating in my head, ""What if things went south?"" This guy could've easily been a catfish, his name could've been fake, if she didn't want to do something, something could've happened and she may never left. I couldn't take that risk. 

Please you guys, I know this is mostly about fun and jokes and weird profiles and shit but please think rationally before agreeing to meet with people. 

Screenshot their faces and send it to a friend. 

Text your friend(s) your whereabouts.

Had been seeing a girl from Tinder for a while and things were kinda getting serious. One day I went over her house as usual but she was acting distant like she didn’t want me to be there. So I pack my shit up to leave but as I’m leaving she bursts out into tears asking me to stay. I’m like wtf so I hug her and asks her what’s wrong and I don’t really remember what happened next but fast forward we start drinking that night and she gives me head and immediately after giving me head, she tells me that her father raped her and her sister growing up. She tells me about her whole childhood and how her mom wouldn’t believe her when she told her about the rape. 

Immediately after dropping this bombshell on me, she pulls her pants down and starts masturbating and starts begging me to watch her masturbate. I made her put her clothes back on and stayed with her the rest of the night until she sobered up.",sexual assault,holding crazy ass story long ass time happened back seeing girl tinder things kin the getting serious one day went house usual acting distant like didnt want there pack shit leave i am leaving bursts tears asking stay i am like wtf hug asks whats wrong dont really remember happened next fast forward start drinking night gives head immediately giving head tells father raped sister growing up tells whole childhood mom wouldnt believe told rape immediately dropping bombshell me pulls pants starts masturbating starts begging watch masturbate made put clothes back stayed rest night sobered up,girl mental breakdown

36,Harassed For 3 Months,31,11,07/01/2021,"Back in 2017 when I was 19, I was freshly single,I had just came out of an abusive relationship and I thought I was ready to date since I was working at a new job and felt content in my life. I was really stupid at that time of my life. I was swiping through matches and it wasn’t till then I swiped right on a guy with curly hair. I was really into bad boys at the time, he was covered in tattoos and had a Lana Del Ray tattoo (talk about bad). He also looked crazy which I thought,
   ”Hey every girl needs a pit bull on a leash just in case.” 
We began fo talk and he asked what I was doing, I literally told him I was eating Chex Mix and he replied that he has a wholesale box of Chex Mix and that no one in his family liked them. He insisted that we meet up so he could give me the whole box, it sounds weird right? 
So in his profile pictures he had photos of him working at the oil refineries of California, a photo of him with an old skool mustang, and him wearing a bullet proof vest. I was more interested in the Lana Del Rey tattoo,it was really funny. 

We exchange numbers and we began to plan a day to hang out, and thats where he told me that he’s a crippled. I asked what made him say that and he sends me this online news article of how him and his brother where both in a car accident which basically should of taken their lives but they some how pulled through. I told him I didnt care, if their where places we couldn’t go to it was completely fine with me.

I drove to this really nice suburban neighborhood where he lived to pick him up to get ice cream. When I saw him I noticed he had a limp, he explained how he’s been in physical therapy for a couple of months and from there we began to chat about what we did for a living. Two things made me uncomfortable, he kept calling me “babe” the whole time and he kept showing off his cash,
    ” Your man is ballin look at this VL wallet and my shoes this could be all yours too if you be with me.”

 I kind of laughed it off and thought to myself,
 “ Wow imma ghost him.” 

It seemed like the whole 2 hours we spent together was him talking about his accident he had, and the reason why he got Lana Del Rey was because he loved her. We drove around his city to see what was cool and the whole time he kept telling me I looked like Selena(yeah if she was fat and swam in nuclear waste), that anyone would easily fall in love with me, and that I was “the illest”. I  told him I really doubt that and my mom would say the exact opposite. As we where getting ice cream he said that he was going to get his whole family ice cream and had asked if we can drop it off. Since Im a decent person I didn’t mind, but it wasnt until we arrived he was begging me to meet his family and introduce me as his girlfriend. I told him I was not getting down since it seemed really inappropriate and he said that I should help the crippled,I still politely said no. Also how off putting is it to meet someone’s family literally the first tome you meet someone?

I dropped him off and went back home thinking what I put myself through and then I heard my phone buzz. I look at it and see that this guy sent me a screenshot of his lock screen with my photo as the lock screen. I was shocked and horrified, I had no idea how to respond the only thing I could think of was saying,
” God I look fat in that photo can you change it?” 

He sent me a photo of an invitation for a party being held at the hospital he was treated at for his injuries and asked if I could come. I simply told him I didnt feel right going since I only met him 2 hours ago. He got really angry and began saying I was a terrible person and I should be his girlfriend because he could give me the world and his car. He started to send me audio recording of him saying what he would do to me if I was undresses. This all happened in one day and I thought I was in a telenovela. I immediately blocked him and just told myself ,” Okay on to the next guy.” 

I began to get phone calls from this guy telling me that I was a bitch for not loving him! SIR I ONLY MET YOU FOR 2 HOURS AND YOURE NEVER GOING TO SEE ME AGAIN. 
He began to call me from his siblings phone, or scam numbers saying the same exactly thing or that I’m fat and stupid to not be with a rich man and this was for about 3 weeks. For a whole month I had to block about a dozen accounts. He kept asking for my forgiveness and that if I gave him a chance I would be the luckiest person alive. Upon those messages he would keep sending me the same article about his accident trying to make me feel sorry for him. The dude would also comment on photos begging for forgiveness and even once commenting that he wished he could do coke on my body, mind you im not into doing drugs (drug of choice is food) and   im the most average chubby girl you’ll ever meet. I told him that I didnt care at all if he was in an accident or not I just didnt want to be harassed anymore. I would still get messages saying that I’m Selena reincarnated and that he had to have me, I obviously ignored these messages but still slightly worried. 

Im glad I never told this dude where I lived, I mentioned that I lived close to a certain city but it wasnt until I got a message from him saying,” i’ve been driving around said so city looking for you can we please talk?” I couldn’t believe, I never once had this experience ever in my life. I went to the police station so someone could take down a statement, of course nothing happened. 

On the third month I almost got use to the harassing messages and it wasnt until the end of that August that I got a message from him. It was a photo of his “survivor” certificate he got at the hospital with a messaging saying that he was sorry and didnt mean to scare me, that he only wanted to love me, and I should date him because he got a second chance at life, plus he wants to do coke on my rear. 

For the second time responding to his scary messages I told him that his bullshit was forgiven and that I hope he has a good life. He then told me he hoped I got punched in the face. 

That was the worst Tinder date I ever experienced.

37,Just a friendly reminder for those on Tinder for more than a hookup that it’s possible!,31,14,02/12/2021,"I think I hit the worst cesspool of Tinder when I used to live in Florida. Like.... CESSPOOL.

One time had a guy lie about his height, in reality being 4 inches shorter than me without heels and I wore 4 inch heels to the date. Same guy actually had the audacity to get out of his Kia Rio and insult my 550hp Camaro as “just not the best option out there, kinda a sad looking car really.”
Needless to say - I gave him a weird look, silently got back in my car, and gave an extra “fuck you” rev on my way out.

I have had some fucking shit show adventures I only thought happened on sitcoms - but no - that’s Tinder.

Then I met my boyfriend who was also horrified at the realities of Tinder (and also thought I was a catfish and took a MONTH of convincing to go on a date.)

Welp. We’ve been together for 5 years now, own a house, have tons of pets instead of kids, and his Trans Am is an actually respectable opponent LMAO

39,Tinder gold feels like a scam or unfair,29,25,02/10/2022,"A month ago I decided to try Tinder, and upon creating my account I had a few likes immediately and a few everyday for a week. Of course I wanted to see who they were. So Tinder threw gold in my face and my impulsive inner was too curious so I bought a month.

Over the month I noticed I was getting nothing, not a single like, and it wasn't until I cancelled and let it expire that I started getting likes again, and every other day after.

Was I unlucky for an entire month or does gold put you into another pool of people?

40,Everything that's wrong with your Tinder profile,29,27,19/09/2021,"A PSA. 

Apologies if this topic is frequent/overdone; I'm just fed up and needed to vent a little, and didn't see any recent/relevant threads to add to. 

A (despite title) definitely incomplete list of off-putting profile clichés. I encourage you to add your own.

\- ""I just need a plus one for a wedding"" hur hur I am too cool for dating  
\- Writing about dating like it's a job application  
\- ""Free to good home""  
\- Looking for someone ""like-minded""; does not indicate what mind is like  
\- Looking for a ""partner in crime"" (nice try, NSA)  
\- ""Just ask""  
\- Cute pics, no bio  
\- Bio is only emojis  
\- Bio punctuates every other word with an emoji illustrating that word, like it's a reading aid for language-learners  
\- Pictures flipping off the camera  
\- Pictures clearly taken at least a decade apart  
\- ""Here's me and a car""  
\- ""Here's me and a fish""  
\- \*toxic positivity vibes\*  
\- Snapchat filters  
\- Complaints in bio about other people's use of snapchat filters/makeup/etc.  
\- Entreaties in bio to not be a catfish (seriously, who are these for?)  
\- Preemptively scolding potential matches for not replying to messages  
\- Professes to love Oxford comma; clearly did not proofread own profile  
\- ""Open-minded""  
\- ""Sarcastic""  
\- ""Sapiosexual""

41,I was BANNED from tinder AND bumble.,29,28,05/05/2021,"So as the title reads, I was banned from tinder and bumble. Let me set the scene for you. At the height of covid, mid 2020, I quit my job and made an onlyfans account, and moved to Florida. As a 29 year old man I didnt think it would work very well but as it turns out it wasn’t a bad side hustle. I also started driving for door dash and was doing ok financially.
But moving to a new state at that age was rough especially with covid, it was hard making friends or even getting laid. That’s when I decided to get on tinder and bumble to simply try to land a mate.
I had gotten tired of being asked the question, “what do you do?” and wasn’t quite sure what to put in that job title line in my about me.
So I would just simply state in my about me, in both apps that I have an Onlyfans page. I simply mentioned it! By NO means was I advertising or phishing. If anything it was a buyer beware warning! 
I would rarely match with anyone anyway, and half of said matches found it hot and interesting that I had one. So I had assumed I was reported by some nut case. But it turns out that simply mentioning onlyfans in your about me, is considered phishing or advertising and is call for an automatic ban by both apps/developers. And mind you, I am banned for life! Or until I get a new phone number, which IS NOT happening.",phishing,title reads banned tinder bumble let set scene you height covid mid quit job made onlyfans account moved flori the year old man didnt think would work well turns wasnt bad side hustle also started driving door dash ok financially moving new state age rough especially covid hard making friends even getting laid thats decided get tinder bumble simply try land mate gotten tired asked question do wasnt quite sure put job title line me would simply state me apps onlyfans page simply mentioned it means advertising phishing anything buyer beware warning would rarely match anyone anyway half said matches found hot interesting one assumed reported nut case turns simply mentioning onlyfans me considered phishing advertising call automatic ban apps developers mind you banned life get new phone number happening,banned tinder bumble

43,Umm??? Help??? Tinder Stalker,28,9,12/01/2020,"Okay so, I (F, 19) have been on Tinder for around 8 or 9 months; don't really use it for anything other than a way to kill the time. Flashback to my freshman year of high school, there was this kid in a class of mine that was a couple years older  and nothing short of obsessed with me. For simplicity sake, we're gonna call him John. John would ask me out, I'd say no, he'd ask me out again, and I would get increasingly more and more uncomfortable as I learned that he truly didn't understand the meaning of the word 'no.' It eventually came to a point where I said I flat out didn't like boys, to which I received a one word answer: so? Instagram DMs continued to piled up from him in my inbox. Finally drawing the line, I blocked him on everything to carry on with my life.

Fast forward to the summer before my freshman year in college. I was fresh out of a long term relationship and trying to get back onto my feet- this is when Tinder entered the picture. I lived in a smaller town, so I couldn't say I was surprised to see this kid from years before on my screen. Despite the lack of surprise, I still felt my stomach drop. Not thinking too much into it, I swiped left and forgot about it. Two or three days later, I open up tinder again. I'm swiping through and I see John *again*. This time, he Superliked me. Again, swiped left. A week later, no Superlike but I find him again. And again. And again.

This ordeal began in around June; it's January now and I will see this guy's account at least once a week. I've begun to screenshot his profile every time it comes up on my phone, as well as report the account. I'm certain it's not a catfish, he's verified with Tinder U and his distance is the same each time.

44,SCAM/CATFISH Reminder,26,4,20/09/2020,"After a run in of my own last night, I figured it would be pertinent to throw out a reminder for everyone. In this case, the girl I matched with was a bit older (I’m in college) but we matched nonetheless. She said she was pretty new to the app and wanted to switch right over to text because she didn’t want her coworkers to see her on tinder. That’s the first red flag, because it’s easier for scammers/hackers to get information and whatnot over text. There were also a couple slip ups grammatically, where there might be something like “Hey , “ where the comma was spaced from the word, which isn’t always an issue but given the situation I thought it wasn’t too convincing. She then invited me to her place pretty shortly afterwords, and offered to pick me up. If possible, the first meeting should always be in public, and you want to have your own transportation just in case something goes awry. I asked for a picture with a fork to make sure she was who she said she was and she ignored/deflected it, which is also a huge red flag. She also mentioned using Noonlight, which is partnered with tinder so that was all good, but after setting it up she asked for my safe code. There’s no reason why she would need that unless she was to cancel a Noonlight request, which was super suspicious. From there I just cut it, since I figured the potential was not worth the risk. Anyways, I figured I could share as a reminder to some of the warning signs on dating apps.

45,Why block someone after a hookup?,26,16,30/09/2020,"I hear about this happening a lot and I just don’t get the thought process? If you’re someone who does this is it because it was unenjoyable? It’s only ever happened to me once but it seemed super odd to me. He drove an hour at 1am to come see me, added music I showed him to his Spotify, cuddled with me while he played his mom’s favorite movie, hung around talking to me for at least an hour and before he left added my apartment complex website to his favorites on his phone because he said he was planning on moving closer soon, hugged me goodbye, and probably before he even got to his car I was blocked everywhere.  I literally thought he might’ve robbed me.  Sex lasted approximately 2 minutes with no foreplay and an intermission where he asked me what an iud was and if that meant he didn’t need the condom, and when he stuck his tongue down my throat it tasted like cigarettes.  He kept saying how hot I was and how good it was but needless to say I wasn’t super keen to have him back anyway. Still, why fake so much interest even after sex if he was just going to block me? It seems weird to lie that hard but idk.

46,Tinder is a Scam,26,27,15/09/2021,"Tinder makes a massive amount of money out of fake profiles and scam profiles. These profiles often have the most attractive photos. These photos attract “Super Likes,” which users have to pay a lot of money for. Most damning, when fake or scam profiles are reported and banned, users are NOT compensated by receiving their Super Like back. Therefore Tinder has a very strong incentive to do nothing about fake and scam profiles because they makes lots of money on them.

47,Hookup leads to going to dealers house and hotel?,25,47,31/12/2018,"I’m 18 and I match with this 28 y/o Lebanese woman. She asks if I’m busy (her families visiting tomorrow) so I ask her a video confirmation that she is who she is. Now I’m otw and she says she’s gonna pick up supplies from her friend. That sounds like some sociopath shit so I ask her what supplies to which she replies sugar and mint. So I’m like ok great she’s getting coke (sarcastic). Anyways I go to her friends house where I’m gonna pick her up and walk with her to her place. She ends up holding the door for me when I get there and I go inside. Then I find out he’s a drug dealer that apparently went on tour with Beyoncé. So we’re just sitting there I’m thinking about whether I’m gonna get run up on or if this guys a pimp or some shit. There end up being like seven people that come in and out buying coke. I’m talking with the guy setting myself up as someone no one should fuck with just in case something goes wrong and I gotta go all cowboy bebop mode. Long story short I get the dealers number because I used to be one myself and we end up leaving to her go to her place. Now I’m thinking it’s gonna be an apartment but nope it’s a hotel. Now I heavily start getting paranoid that the guy was her “security guard” and that if I have sex with her I’m gonna end up getting charged 1000$ or some stupid shit. Regardless I go up with her because I like surreal experiences. We’re chilling and everything she’s been doing drugs this entire time. Drinking coke weed etc. we go downstairs to the bar after she changes into her jeans. Now she’s drinking rosé which seems like a typical prostitute drink. Although she’s incredibly smart. She apparently went to college and owns her own buisiness. She lives in LA and comes to New York for business or something can’t remember. Now I’m overly paranoid because of my past with drug dealing. So my minds working on five levels. 1. This is a set up 2.im boutta get charged by a pimp 3. She’s a sociopath 4. Analyzing my surrounding 5. She’s really beautiful intelligent and someone I want to get to know. While we’re sitting at the bar this guy who looks just like Donald Glover comes in and starts dancing JUST LIKE DONALD GLOVER. I’m astonished by what’s happening because I’m not used to sitting in a grand hotel bar with cushiony seats and Donald Glover dancing out of no where. I’m in sweatpants and a adidas hoodie surrounded by people in suits possible mob bosses and tech pioneers. We go outside to smoke (I can’t smoke weed for a drug test) and we talk. Due to my mind racing I can’t really flirt and I’m probably secreting a bunch of paranoid pheromones next to a phycology student who’s prolly understanding of what I’m going through. While we’re outside she talks about how I’m her friend again and how she either views someone as life long friends or someone she doesn’t know. Then proceeds to talk about a dildo and basically she planned to use said strap on on me and “rape” me. (Fetish). I had bisexual on my profile so makes sense. I’d gladly try it out but I said no because I’m paranoid on so many levels. So she orders another rosae etc etc I’m ready to leave but I left my stuff upstairs. Eventually we go back up it’s 3 am now and I get my stuff ready and I’m about to leave. I do this really awkward thing with her hair because I’ve been socially isolated from people because I think they’re possible snitches etc so I haven’t been able to talk to old friends and need some physical interaction. I plan on kissing her before I leave so I grab her neck and go for it. She pulls away and explains that she’s flattered and brings up the friend thing. I tell her that’s ok I just wanted to kiss you before I left. I get my jacket on I’m about to leave and she runs up to me and kisses me. I didn’t expect it so subpar kiss. I’m at the door and I ask her if she minds if I kiss her again. She laughs and says wasn’t that one good. I say it could’ve been better. She says I still feel you right here pointing at her lips. When I’m leaving I say “by the way I think you’re a great person” she says something along the lines of you too smiling with her beautiful smile and curly hair as she’s rolling up. Now reddit. I want your opinion. Did I just miss out on a great woman or was this most likely some prostitution shit or even possibly a setup because lord my minds all over the place. It helped me realize that I can’t live with this paranoia and that I’m probably fine.

Last time I was on the app it was december, and I didn't get that many matches so I deleted the app. Fast forward to three days ago, I reinstalled the app and paid for Tinder Plus. My matches definitely went up this time, but the responses were very spotty and random. I asked one of my matches out to drink coffee, and she gave me her number. A day later she says there's a networking event at 9pm that I should attend. I got there, and boy let me tell you she looked so different from her pictures and was really nervous. I had my suspicions so I approach this building with my date, and I spend the next hour talking to another lady (tinder date's friend) who is trying to get me a job as a life insurance agent. Now, I don't known if I was delusional, but the girl explaining the job kept hitting me with her foot. It felt like she was trying to seduce me.

50,"I reported an underage user a couple of days ago, but my friend unknowingly matched with her today - how long does it take for Tinder to do something?",24,9,31/05/2021,"So as the title says, I matched with a ""21"" year old girl, her photos made her appear mature enough, but as the convo went on, I asked her if she was in her studies or working anywhere.

She said: ""Still in high school 😬"", adding later that she's 16.

I told her I could not do anything with her, and later on reported her profile for being underage.

My friend also uses Tinder and has today shown me his matches... There, I saw a familiar face. He didn't initiate anything with her, but the profile was pretty much the aforementioned girl. 

I told him to report the profile, but I was wondering - does Tinder actually take a while to verify the profile or did she manage to scam the verification?

52,Get your popcorn and hold on because this is a s^*! show!,21,4,22/06/2022,"Let me start off this wild tale with a few disclaimers:
-It is going to be long. But I promise that I think it is worth it for the pure “WTF” of it all.
-It’s quite possible no one is going to read this and I am fine with that. I think typing this all out will help me to let go of the situation. But maybe there will be someone out there who can share some insight that myself and my friends haven’t already thought of!
-I wish I was making any of this up….. but I can assure you, I am not.

In the beginning of May, I downloaded Tinder on a whim. I have never had a Tinder profile before (I know, I know…pretty late to the game). I figured I was ready to give dating another shot but wanted to be more open minded and less judge mental than I have been in the past.
I was on for 2 days and I matched with a guy. Same age as me, same city. He had 7 photos all seemingly legit. We messaged back and forth for a day and then I gave him my number. We started texting and made specific plans for the Friday of that same week. He is a pilot, who flies internationally but his home base is my city. He would be leaving for a work trip 2 days after our agreed upon date and would be gone for 2 weeks.  I know nothing about pilots schedules, etc. so I didn’t blink an eye at this. The day before our date, he texts me (mind you we have been consistently texting all along), that he had been called into a meeting and needed to start work earlier than expected because a colleague tested positive for Covid. He was very apologetic and upset about this, I told him no worries, we could pick back up after his trip. The texting doesn’t stop…if anything it picks up. We are talking about everything in life. I learn that he was born and raised in France, he has an 11 year old son, etc. We are talking about the things we want to do when he returns from his trip as he is newer to my city and hasn’t had much time to explore.
During this time, I do all the stuff I was taught to do by growing up on the show “Catfish”. I google everything. I reverse image search every photo he has sent me or put on his Tinder profile. Nothing at all comes up. This is definitely a bit strange to me, but I myself don’t have social media, so who am I to judge?
The date he is supposed to come home is Memorial Day. The day before, he tells me that he is stuck because there is an issue with the engine of the plane. The texting continues, we speak on the phone a few times and he continues to be gone. Another week passes, another two weeks pass….. and now I am getting an awful feeling. My suspicions are at an all time high. How can an employer just leave an employee stranded in another country for weeks on end? Doesn’t add up.

And of course it didn’t add up…. Because it wasn’t true.

Last night, he tells me he woke up from a nap and went and got dinner. This was questionable to me because in the country he was claiming to be in this whole time, it would have been almost midnight. I ask him “what time is it there?”, just to see his answer. “10pm” he responds. Wrong. Now I am letting on that I am suspicious and he is catching on.  I stop texting and put my sharpest detective skills to work…. Think Kris Jenner “This is a case for the FBI” gif.

I decide that I am going to look up the airline he flies for. I don’t have facebook, but I know sometimes you can see pages without having to log in. I get to their page and decide I am going to look at the likes on the posts and see if I can find him. Clearly, I’ve been given a fake name so this is a lot harder than it seems. I search and search and then bingo. I find his Facebook… my best friend finds a twitter account, a private instagram account and a freaking youtube channel. W.T.F. Now here is where it gets even more bizarre… a lot of the stuff *whoever I was talking to* told me about “themselves” matches up with what we are seeing on the various social media accounts. Even the way in which he types, etc. What doesn’t match up? Well for starters, the name. Secondly, there is no evidence of him ever having been in my city or even in the US for that matter. There is also absolutely no evidence of a son. Who lies about having kids…isn’t it usually the other way? Nothing about a current or former wife/girlfriend… nothing. So THIS guy is real….but was he who I was talking to? Who the hell knows? I was either talking to this actual person who made up stuff for some absolutely psychotic reason… or I was talking to someone with an intimate knowledge of this person, pretending to be him. 

Never in this 6 weeks of conversing, was there any NSFW talk… no exchange of inappropriate photos. I was never asked for money. In fact, money and finances were never even brought up. So what was the point of all this? What did this person get from me out of this for their own gain?

So what did I do? I sent him screenshots of all the social media profiles and said “you’re an @$$hole, don’t ever message me again”. Then I stayed up all night, ate an entire bag of FaveReds Starbursts and bought a Peloton. *Balance* I have now decided I am completely content with spending the rest of my life as the “cool Aunt who never got married and just lived her best life.” People are weird.

58,Not sure what to put as the title,19,8,20/10/2022,"Downloaded tinder after me and my ex split up. During the first day I matched with a very cute girl, that had a lot of tastes in common with me. She texted first and we kept talking and both came to the conclusion that at this point we were both just looking for casual sex so we planned to hang out the next day at my place. 

At first it was super fun, we listened to music together (I never found anyone with such a similar musical taste), we played videogames, had some beers and just talked about stuff.

As things progressed, when she took her clothes off I noticed she had some scars on her body, that I recognized because in my early teen years I gone through something similar. Obviously I didn’t mention anything. Then I noticed that she was all bruised up everywhere. I asked if she was ok and she said that she just enjoyed the pain. 

I’m a bit vanilla when it comes to sex so I was a bit scared when she mentioned that. What really threw me off was when she said that it was ok if I rape her during the night”. 

I know some people see it as a fetish but hearing that during sex which for me it’s a moment of a lot of vulnerability be it casual or not casual sex, threw me completely off and didn’t want to have sex so she was a bit frustrated at me. We both fell asleep a bit after.

In the morning we both had breakfast and left for work. I am now thinking constantly about her, if she is ok, or if something happened to her. Is it normal or am I being too conservative and judging?

59,Live Scam in Progress!,19,9,10/05/2021," I just signed up for Tinder Platinum about 3 weeks ago. The aim was to find a steady girlfriend. At first I was really enjoying all of the matches I was getting with some very attractive women. Most of them were also quick to move the conversation onto another messaging app. I live in Japan, so I mostly use LINE but have had a few women request my WhatsApp or WeChat. I also noticed that sometimes they would un-match me on Tinder once we moved to the other app.

After a while I started noticing that many of the women were into cryptocurrecy trading. They would talk about making $8,000 in one day and making $200,000 over the course of a few years. They would often send me screenshots of their trading screens showing how much money they made. Many of them said they were getting investment advice from their uncle. Yes, it seemed that everyone had some kind of ""uncle"" who had insider trading information.

At first I believed them.

""Wow,"" I thought. ""Everyone is talking so much about crypto! I didn't realize how popular it was!""

Not only that, these women were also rich and running successful businesses. A lot of them had their own clothing shops. Some of them were students or did real estate.

Wow! All of these rich beautiful women on Tinder are matching with me and wanting to pass on insider advice from their uncles. This is too good to be true!

However, I started to notice that although these women were happy to chat on LINE and seemed very interested in me, none of them would let me call them, and when I asked them on a date, they would say that they didn't know me well enough yet and that they were ""traditional Asian girls"" and didn't ""meet"" as soon as Americans did.

Fine, okay. But why were all of them so adamant about sharing their investment strategies with me? There had to be some kind of scam involved.

So I did some research about Tinder scams and learned a thing or two about some of the things that could happen. One scam that worried me was about SIM swapping, where the scammer could call up your phone company, pretend to be you, and get your phone number transferred from your SIM card to theirs. They could then easily access your e-mail, bank accounts, etc. because they now could receive your texts and bypass 2-step authentication.

""Omg,"" I thought. ""I gave my phone number to some of these women so that they could add me on WhatsApp! I hope they're not trying to scam me""

It seemed that a more common scam, however, was getting the victim to register on a phoney site or sign into the scammer's account and upload personal information. Another common one was the victim sending the scammer Bitcoin, thinking that they would get their coins back plus interest.

So, after reading this, it was like I couldn't trust anyone on Tinder anymore. Every new match I got I was suspicious of. Here's the story of one woman who was particularly obvious, and who I am now trying to catch red-handed scamming me. If you guys have any advice or insight, please share!

This woman's name on Tinder and on LINE was Lulu, but she introduced herself as Keiko Nagasawa. I reverse image searched all of her pictures, and they all checked out---i.e. they weren't stolen from the internet. She would talk to me nearly every day and seemed very interested, but, of course, she would occasionally drop crypto into the conversation every now and then. She said that she had her own clothing store in Shibuya, which is close to where I live, so I told her, ""Wow, we're so close! I go to Shibuya almost every day!"" I asked if she wanted to meet, and she said that she was shy, didn't know me well enough yet, and would be busy until next month. When I asked where her shop was---because I know the area well---she wouldn't tell me and would only say ""It's a small shop, and customers come in by appointment.""

Alright...

So I then asked if I could call her and have a chat, but she said that she couldn't talk, that she was too busy and she was worried about her poor English skills.

Alright...

But then one day, it was almost as if she had exploded. She texted me a longer-than-usual message saying that she was so happy to meet me and that she really trusted me and that she could see a wonderful future ahead for us. Even marriage! She was so happy, and she wanted to tell me of this great crypto investment opportunity that we could get in on together. She was learning how to invest from a ""teacher,"" and she and I could be very rich together and lead a happy life if we followed his advice.

Whoa, hold on there...

You already see a wonderful future with me and want to invest in crypto together, and we haven't even met in person? Some stranger on the internet? And you won't even talk to me on the phone?

She then doubled back, saying that she was sorry that it all came gushing out like that. She said that she was reluctant to meet me for a date because she had been assaulted in the past and even reading the word ""meet"" was traumatizing for her. But she said that I was different, and she could see herself opening up to someone like me in the future because she felt she could trust me.

Yeah, right. You don't trust me enough to meet me on a date, but you trust me enough to invest in crypto together...

So I stop talking to her for a day, and she messages me back tonight as if nothing happened. This time she asks if I can help her out with something. She's supposed to meet with her ""teacher"" tonight but is too busy, so asks me to log into her crypto account for her and add the teacher on LINE so he can tell me what to do.

At this point, I'm just going along with it to see how a scam actually plays out. I also think that by playing along I might be able to gather enough information to show the police and prevent scams like this from happening in the future. So I tell her that I'll help her and that I'll just do what she tells me to do. So she asks me to download an app called MetaTrade4 and log into her account. I tell her that I'm not so good with technology and for her to send me screenshots of how to do what she's telling me to do. So she sends me the screenshots, and I tell her that I'm in the process of downloading the app (I'm not, actually). I then ask what time she needs this done by, and she says by 8 or 9pm. I lie again and say that I'm a little busy tonight and have to stay in Shibuya for a while longer...but I could stop by her shop in Shibuya to do it together in person! She says she's got a meeting and is too busy to meet. I haven't messaged her back yet.

So, what should I do? I want to catch this girl! I want to call her a scamming little c\*\*\* and get her thrown in jail. Any advice greatly appreciated. I'm gonna see if I can extend our little dialogue until tomorrow, but I don't want to go too far and expose myself to danger!

60,Serious question: what do you do when catfished?,19,79,31/10/2022,"So I was catfished/fat fished for a third time. She showed up and she was about 30 to 50 lb more than her pics. She must have used pre pandemic pics. I video chatted with her. She used great angles to optimize everything. She didn’t have much face fat but she was carrying it all in her gut, arms, legs, etc, which I just couldn’t see. 

When we first met, she insulted the way I dressed. And then wanted me to pay for all the food. 2 minutes into meeting her, I was honest, told her that I wasn’t interested and just left before I even ordered anything. 

How’s the best way to handle this when you get catfished despite video chatting and verifying with photos? Just say I’m not interested and just bolt like i did? Call her out for the catfish? I’m concerned she will make a scene. Just say that I need to grab my wallet from my car and never return? What’s the best way to get out without wasting time and money with someone who’s intentions are to lie all while trying to spare her feelings and not have it blow up in my face?",catfish,catfished fat fished third time showed lb pics must used pre pandemic pics video chatted her used great angles optimize everything didnt much face fat carrying gut arms legs etc couldnt see first met insulted way dressed wanted pay food minutes meeting her honest told wasnt interested left even ordered anything hows best way handle get catfished despite video chatting verifying photos say i am interested bolt like did call catfish i am concerned make scene say need grab wallet car never return whats best way get without wasting time money someone whos intentions lie trying spare feelings blow face,serious question catfished

62,"ValenTinder – Red, White and Blue (balls)",19,2,12/02/2015,"The great Whitney Houston once said “Some people wait a lifetime for a moment like this”. It’s the Super Bowl of one night stands, the World Series of opening lines and the Boxing Day of emotions, and morals and clothes are half off. **It’s Valentine’s Day**. You have been using your [Tech Decks](http://i.imgur.com/mPKwv7o.png) for weeks preparing your fingers for the physical assault. The McDonald’s of sex is open and you want a Big Mac. It’s your moment and not even Kanye West can interrupt it. 

**The Metrics**

The first step after downloading tinder is to set your preferences. Age and gender preferences are entirely up to you. I just warn when you play in the 18 age range you will find a lot of “sorry actually 16, Facebook won’t let me change it”. Attention to details are important so you don’t spend Valentine’s Day with [Chris Hansen](http://i.imgur.com/RTHOh87.png). My only recommendation is to set a reasonable search radius of about 20 miles. You’re trying to find someone to hang out with, not a location to take a SpaceX trip to.

**The Photos**

Think of this of your highlight reel of life. This is your chance to show off that you did cool shit like skydive without boring your friends with the same story over and over. Through years of research, and just a touch of luck, I have discovered the perfect combination of photos needed to make girls swipe right faster than Michael J. Fox. 

**Profile Photo** – This is the photo that pops up during the opening process and is the most important. They say don’t judge a book by its cover but this is Tinder and you’re not a fucking book. Here I advise you use your most adventurous/mysterious photo. Can only see half your face in it? Perfect, entice them to keep scrolling.

**Second Photo** - The animal photo. Every girl has cried while eating a gallon of Haagen Daz to [Marley & Me](http://i.imgur.com/Lp2QZCC.png) or has a favourite stuffed animal. Don’t have a pet? Use your friends. Don’t have friends? Go adopt one for the photo and then release it into the wild. They didn’t sign a waiver for this feels trip but they’re on it and you’re driving.

**Remaining Photos** – This is where you highlight your best assets. If you’re muscular, use a photo of you (pretending not to flex) at the beach. If you play guitar, show a photo of you performing. Simple? Yes. The group photos seem to carry a stigma but using it later in your photos is a plus. It shows you actually have friends and you’re not planning on murdering her in a dark alley.

**The Bio**

You switched your opening photo from your mirror selfie and you’re actually getting the look over. The next stage of the process is the bio. The point of the bio isn’t to actually get to know someone, it’s for opening liners. No one cares that you: like football, you’re new to this app and you ~*~*~live for the nights you can’t remember with the people you will never forget ~*~*. Put something humorous to initiate the conversation like “Born to be the big spoon” or more specifically “Looking for an Anastasia Steele to my Christian Grey”. 

**Tinder Moments**

Don’t.

**The Opener**

Congratulations! You have a new match! And it’s not a bot. The first rule is, hey is for horses and people who get ignored. Don’t send a generic reply and pull a [Marcus Aurelius](http://i.imgur.com/D4zU9Iw.png) staring at a blank screen. Use humour, use their bio or use their name in a pun. Remember you are both clearly sexually attracted to each other so see if you are now emotionally. /r/tinder is your friend.
	
I’ve done all I can now, the phone is in your hands. Happy Hunting.

63,Need advice on how to date while having body dysmorphia,18,8,11/09/2019,I got tinder and it’s unreal to me that I’ve actually been getting matched with attractive people. The only issue is I strongly believe I’m a catfish which is why I haven’t met with anyone. My friend assures me that the pictures I’ve uploaded look like me but I don’t believe her. It’s not like I think my pictures are incredibly good but because I’m getting matched with good looking guys I don’t think it looks like me. In real life guys like that don’t look my way. It’s tough because I feel like I’m ready to date as I just got out of a relationship a couple months ago. I’m just so afraid of being rejected or being a disappointment because I don’t look like my pictures. I even made sure all my pictures aren’t filtered and I included some body pics. I tried to keep it as real as possible but I still believe i look fatter and uglier in person. Anyways I’m kinda looking for tips on how to build up the courage and just go on a date.,catfish,got tinder unreal ive actually getting matched attractive people issue strongly believe i am catfish havent met anyone friend assures pictures ive uploaded look like dont believe her like think pictures incredibly good i am getting matched good looking guys dont think looks like me real life guys like dont look way tough feel like i am ready date got relationship couple months ago i am afraid rejected disappointment dont look like pictures even made sure pictures arent filtered included body pics tried keep real possible still believe look fatter uglier person anyways i am kin the looking tips build courage go date,need advice date body dysmorphia

67,This just happened to me on Tinder. Has this happened to you?,16,14,13/06/2021,"Si I matched with this very hot looking girl who said she was in the same state as me, but about2 hours away. We matched in the morning. We chatted back and fourth for about an hour and i headed out to meet some friends. She continued to chat with me on the Tinder app, asking me many questions and sending me a few non-nude pics. She suggested we move to WhatsApp so i gave her my number and she immediately messaged me n the other app. 

We chatted back and forth for a few hours. Just 'getting to know you' chat: What is your favorite food, color, etc. Everything seemed good and i was a little skeptical because she was really attractive. She mentioned that she had a boyfriend but he cheated on her. I found that hard to believe, but hey i went with it. We continued chatting while i was with friends. 

&#x200B;

I got home and she messaged me again. Everything was going great and then she says 'can i ask you a question?'

I was like, sure. Ask me anything...

She says, 'just forget because i you probably won't do it anyway'.

I asked her several times what it was and she refused to say...

Finally, i ask her again and she tells me. She wants me to buy her a Google Play card..

I start questioning her why she would ask a complete stranger to buy her a Google Play card (whatever tf that is) and she says forget it, lets talk about something else.

I was like, 'Cat is out of the bag!' What is up with this Google Play card (i Googled it to see what it is)

Why does she need one? Why doesn't she just go out and buy one herself. She continued trying to defend herself until it got ugly.

I told her i knew she was trying to scam me, that she was probably not the person in the pics and probably not even a woman!

She said , whatever. She continued denying everything as i called her out and she just said whatever.

When I went back to Tinder, she had already unmatched me and I couldn't report her. I did however figure out a way to report her, but i don't think anything will come of it.

""Ok let me ask him (insert few minutes) ok he said you're on the guest list! Just meet us there at 11"" 

**Rosebudd invites buddy, which is extremely excited because her girlfriend was also gorgeous. We get dressed up, I put on an Eau De Parfum instead of De Toilette 

We arrive at the nightclub, go to the guest list line and text her ""Hey i'm here, just waiting in line"" 
She replies ""Perfect, see you soon"" and sends me a picture of her in a blue dress. 

I wait in line and walk inside. 

I text her ""Hey where are you?"" 
""I'll meet you guys by the bar"" 

It's a very small venue, it's only 1 floor and 1 ambient so you can see from corner to corner. I wait near the bar, to a point where i'd see her first...and nothing...I text her ""hey i'm here, I don't see anybody at the bar"" 

No replies. Perhaps cellphone reception inside club is poor. Understandable, i'll find her, blue dress, can't miss. We decide to grab some drinks and walk around. 

My friend and I walked gave around 8 laps around the tiny lounge and couldn't find any girl in a blue dress that night.  Not a single one. 

So I FINALLY have the bright idea to plug her phone number on facebook.....guess what comes up? 

The Facebook account of this fucking douchebag promoter that does in fact date a really hot girl. The pictures were all hers but she was nowhere near the club that night. After I analyzed the pictures I saw that she took a picture next to a long purple light, there were no purple lights at the club I was at. 

As if promoters could get any more sketch...

Very well played, I would never step foot into that place had it not been to meet these girls. He even got us to get drinks there

2) anything other than “I eat ass.” - I know it’s a joke, but a last ditch effort that is explicitly sexual, especially if it’s completely discordant with prior conversation, is likely going to put you on the shit list. The amount it works for…I would guess very small, but “works” only means that it might solicit a response. EG I talked to an obvious catfish out of sheer boredom and curiosity. 

3) “I eat ass” - I guess you if you really feel like you have nothing to lose, at least you’ll give them something to screen shot and laugh about with their friends.",catfish,weve there conversation seems going okay person stops responding alternatives responding with eat ass dont say anything yes heard right zero idea whats going life whether relationship starting get serious work life family stuff anything eat ass know joke last ditch effort explicitly sexual especially completely discordant prior conversation likely going put shit list amount works for i would guess small works means might solicit response eg talked obvious catfish sheer boredom curiosity eat ass guess really feel like nothing lose least youll give something screen shot laugh friends,instead eat ass alternative approaches
79,dating apps have become an avenue for men to ask for nudes,14,43,05/05/2022,"Literally I get asked dozens of times a day to send screenshots or video of myself masturbating and it's honestly disturbing 😐 I even put in my profile I want a relationship. And I still match with people that say they do too but want to get explicit content not actually get to know me. It's disgusting. Like I'm tired of this stream of communication because I wish it were easy to find a guy that isn't just interested in me sexually but also romantically. Maybe I'm just not looking hard enough. And on top of that when I've matched some guys are fucking rude when you don't show them pictures. They attack and criticize you for saying you're not comfortable with sharing lewd photos and like call me a catfish. Most often after I send them a normal picture they wouldn't accuse me of catfishing and instead try to make jabs at my appearance, my personality, or just say some dumb shit after i say no to them along the lines of, ""well you're pretty ugly anyway."" So I'm genuinely asking guys on all dating apps this but why the fuck are you so fucking rude? And on top of that have this unmet need that's hypersexual and you can't even approach women (I'm speaking for myself here, and I identify as a woman), but I don't feel it's necessary to really approach women with the expectation that they should send you naked photos and then get angry with them and put them down online when they refuse. It's disgusting behavior and it needs to stop. If they agree and it's consensual then by all means- go nuts. But to literally put someone down for setting up boundaries is not your right of passage to then put them down and be a fucking jerk just because you can't get laid. Some guys that are like into the apps just for sex should say so not put in their bios ""looking for a relationship"" !! 😒 that would help also with steering clear of you freaks (not that its a bad thing to want these things) but for those of us that dont stop putting us down. Thanks 😊


Edit:  I'm not giving up. Thank you for the supportive comments from everyone (and especially guys bc my faith in yall has tanked over the past few weeks, *sigh* but this was refreshing) like I was honestly curious and it was nice to see something other than trolls and welcomed the good feedback. I will next that shit as one user would say. 💀

Later edit: 

I think it would be helpful to illustrate this. 

This past week: 

I matched with a guy on bumble (we literally were just chatting up like normal) and he got the impression from my bio that I want to hookup (he made a comment about one of my quotes and how it contained something to do with having sex and chilling out that would be my ideal Saturday evening, e.g., whatever- something to that effect was on my profile). They take this information and continue to press it (that would be nice ahaha. I really like that you said that I can totally relate maybe we should hangout tonight). And I would express I'm not interested (I can see where it's going and can tell they're only interested in fucking and nothing else). They took that one detail out of my entire profile and blew that out of context. Then he got fucking mad and started saying to me that I shouldn't be so suggestive online because it led him on. What the FUCK? 

You know what maybe it IS MY FAULT for saying a pleasant saturday evening would be best spent with Bae 😍 ❤️ 💘 😏 😉 maybe 😏 😌 🤔 😉 I'm being suggestive. Maybe that's why I need to take more responsibility and not say suggestive things online because people want me to take full accountability for the words that come out of my mouth! If I say I want sex-- by golly, I better deliver and not disappoint! I cant even say I want to get bagged even though it's been over 5 months and want a relationship at the same time. That's NOT allowed. 


Once I learn that's what their intentions are i make it clear i do not want anything to do w that. But they keep fucking asking for pics 📸 and or continue to engage me in a conversation 🙄 😒 and it leads to me unmatching or blocking. I'm saying yall know I don't want it yet you continue to press it.

Then there's the endless stream of people I end up adding into my phonebook that just asked for my number to well, you guessed it. Just wanted my number to ask for nudes. They bypass all my checks before I give them my number. This is why I feel I cant even do that. How I even got to the point of feeling so comfortable with giving out my number online I don't even know. At one point I thought maybe yall want to be normal and call me or text me and ask to make plans. But instead it's just to get dick pics. 🤷

84,Does it sound like he's cheating through Tinder or am I insecure?,13,19,28/12/2020,"About two months ago, one of my friends screenshotted me a profile she saw on Tinder that appeared like it was my boyfriend's (24). We have been together for 2 years 7 months now and we did not meet on Tinder. I asked him about it, he seemed upset and said someone must be using his photos to catfish people. He handed me his phone right then and Tinder was not downloaded on it. I had no reason not to believe him, so I did. 

Last week, the same thing happened. A different friend of mine called to say she found my boyfriend's profile on Tinder. I told her it was a fake and asked her to report it. They apparently matched and she messaged him back and forth. When she asked where he was, the person on the profile said he was leaving the gym and that's where my boyfriend was at the time. When he got home I asked him again what was going on and if he was using Tinder. He seemed annoyed and gave me his phone for proof after promising he had never used the app before. It wasn't on his phone and had no proof of anything, plus he hasn't been acting shady/weird at all. Not on his phone a lot or any suspicious notifications. So I apologized and dropped it. 


Well this evening he was napping and left his phone in the living room. His alarm was going off so I picked it up to turn it off. Curiousity got the best of me and I unlocked it (I know the passcode) and was playing around. I downloaded Tinder and it opened to the screen where it asks for your phone number.

85,"Tinder Platinum's ""5 superlikes per week"" false advertising. You actually get much less.",13,4,13/10/2021,"I had Googled a lot before upgrading, trying to determine when superlikes refill, and couldn't find anything, so I hope this will start to come up when others search.

I signed up recently for Platinum and used my five superlikes over the course of the week. Used the last one on Saturday. By Monday I still hadn't gotten a refill, so I emailed them to ask how exactly it works. They say ""per week"", so is it a calendar week? Let me explain their scam:

\- There are 4 weeks per month, so 5 superlikes per week should net you 20 per month, right? No, if you use 5 over the course of the week, the most you're going to get per month is 10, not 20, and two weeks of the month you'll be getting 0.

\- The only way you're going to get 20 is if you fire off all 5 in one day, then go seven days without, and repeat.

\- You have to use *all* of your superlikes before it will even begin the process of refilling them.

\- One you do reach zero, it will then wait 7 days to refill you. So that's a full ""week"" where you have none.

Of course it doesn't tell you any of this. Not in their Help section, and certainly not in their advertising of Platinum. When I realized I wasn't getting a refill, and emailed them, even in their email responses they were very vague. She told me roughly how it works, but still claiming it was ""per week"", so when I pressed for clarification, she said she had to escalate my ticket to someone else. He was even more vague, and refused to clarify what a ""week"" means, then said he wouldn't be able to help further.

I'm going to file a complaint with the FTC and encourage you to (just google it) if you're getting ripped off like this as well.

Oddly enough, she said she was from a town thats about an hour from me, but her profile said 9 miles away. tho that might be a tinder mistake idk. I asked her if she wanted to meet up and she said yes so we picked a time/place and I thought it was all good. She also oddly enough only wanted to talk over tinder no snapchat or insta or anything. So im walking up to the park we agreed to meet at and she tells me shes there. I arrive and she's not there. She says she is sitting at some benches but nothing. I assumed at first there was a mistake because in my area there is another park not even a half minute down from this one thats like a hiking trail. ik other people who have accidentally went there before too. So I asked if she went past the place to the other park and she said yes and then said shes on her way back to the right place. Here;s where it gets weird. A few minutes later she messages me saying she tripped and fell and broke her foot, and that I need to come help her and call 911. She says shes out on the side of the street so I walk down towards where she might be, then she says she crawled over to a house and the people there let her in, and (by incredible chance) one of the people there in the house was a nurse and is helping her. She said the house had a yacht parked outside, but i didnt see one. I also did not see any cars parked at either park which got me very suspicious. After a little while, she says shes at the hospital getting an Xray done, and that she PASSED OUT(wow from a broken foot- maybe thats possible tho i actually dont know). This is where I started calling bullshit so I said i think this is a joke. She said shes not lying so eventually I asked her to send a picture of her at the hospital, weird ik lol, but I was so curious fi this actually happened. So she says you cannot send pictures over tinder, which actually it seems that you cant so not wrong, and sends this. prnt . sc photo of a hospital. print . sc/1109mp I checked this link multiple times before opening for viruses and its seems good. its just a hospital photo. After that I said the picture could be any hospital that it proves nothing. I also said I wont believe this if she does not send a picture of herself at the hospital, yes weird ik, but again this is a ridiculous story. At this point I have received no other messages from her.

My guesses/reasonings are these:

1. Could be a prank, however the 9 miles away is confusing since most of my friends are away at college so the one pranking would be someone I barely know. Also if it was a prank they probably would have said something at this point. Pranks are not as fun if the person never knows.
2. Could be an elaborate scam, though I was never asked for information or any of that. Or asked for money, but maybe that's coming after the hospital thing who knows. Usually scammers doing the need money for hospital stuff get to the point relatively quick or dont get as far as making me go out to a park before creating this story. Also the pictures on her profile do not seem fake, there are many and they are not perfect professional pics or blurry nothing pics. it looks like selfies a girl took with her phone.
3. Something else? Im worried this might be some weird hacking trick or some crazy thing where another totally different thing is happening and this situation is created so somehow I am involved and blamed or something for something i have no idea about.

So anyway. THOUGHTS!! please help lol. could not find any similar tinder story anywhere, usually its just about nude scamming or just one of those onlyfans girls with the ""sign up for free and we can meetup"" bullshit.",scam,need yall s help someone give clue whats happening basis story this girl messaged first tinder asked wanted link up talked little college go to oddly enough said town thats hour me profile said miles away tho might tinder mistake idk asked wanted meet said yes picked time place thought good also oddly enough wanted talk tinder snapchat insta anything i am walking park agreed meet tells shes there arrive there says sitting benches nothing assumed first mistake area another park even half minute one thats like hiking trail ik people accidentally went too asked went past place park said yes said shes way back right place here s gets weird minutes later messages saying tripped fell broke foot need come help call says shes side street walk towards might be says crawled house people let in by incredible chance one people house nurse helping her said house yacht parked outside didnt see one also see cars parked either park got suspicious little while says shes hospital getting xray done passed out wow broken foot maybe thats possible tho actually dont know started calling bullshit said think joke said shes lying eventually asked send picture hospital weird ik lol curious fi actually happened says cannot send pictures tinder actually seems cant wrong sends this prnt sc photo hospital print sc mp checked link multiple times opening viruses seems good hospital photo said picture could hospital proves nothing also said wont believe send picture hospital yes weird ik ridiculous story point received messages her guesses reasonings these could prank however miles away confusing since friends away college one pranking would someone barely know also prank probably would said something point pranks fun person never knows could elaborate scam though never asked information that asked money maybe that s coming hospital thing knows usually scammers need money hospital stuff get point relatively quick dont get far making go park creating story also pictures profile seem fake many perfect professional pics blurry nothing pics looks like selfies girl took phone something else i am worried might weird hacking trick crazy thing another totally different thing happening situation created somehow involved blamed something something idea about anyway thoughts please help lol could find similar tinder story anywhere usually nude scamming one onlyfans girls sign free meetup bullshit,mysterious confusing tinder story
92,Never let your lack of matches determine your self worth.,12,7,06/06/2021,"I was feeling lonely and decided to get back into Tinder around 3 weeks ago, hoping I could find someone to connect to. I consider myself a moderately attractive person. Not like a head-turner, but not ugly either, and I have very high self-esteem. 

After 3 weeks I had a grand total of 20 people who swiped right on me. Not matches, just right swipes from the little counter. From that I had about 8 matches, and from those I had 0 conversations lead to anything but ghosting from their end. It was making me feel pretty shitty, and watching my girl friends use tinder and get 1000000 matches a day made me feel even worse. 

But considering the almost 80 20 split of men to women on dating apps, I decided to run a little experiment. I changed absolutely nothing about my profile, but I added guys to the dating pool. 

Literally within 12 hours, the like counter had maxed out. 

Never let your experience on this app make you feel like you aren't worth it. There are just wayyyyy more guys on here than girls, so the odds are stacked against you.
 
And it's not that much better on the girl end.
Watching my girl friends use this, I see that, sure, they get tons of matches, but 90% of them are creeps prepositioning them for sex, or sending them dick pictures. It's hard for them to find a genuine person, and sometimes the self affirmation isn't worth all the rape threats and downright horrible people they have to deal with.

The app is fun and results in lots of great relationships, but try not to put too much weight in something that is essentially dating gambling.",sexual assault,feeling lonely decided get back tinder around weeks ago hoping could find someone connect to consider moderately attractive person like head turner ugly either high self esteem weeks grand total people swiped right me matches right swipes little counter matches conversations lead anything ghosting end making feel pretty shitty watching girl friends use tinder get matches day made feel even worse considering almost split men women dating apps decided run little experiment changed absolutely nothing profile added guys dating pool literally within hours like counter maxed out never let experience app make feel like worth it wayyyyy guys girls odds stacked you much better girl end watching girl friends use this see that sure get tons matches creeps prepositioning sex sending dick pictures hard find genuine person sometimes self affirmation worth rape threats downright horrible people deal with app fun results lots great relationships try put much weight something essentially dating gambling,never let lack matches determine self worth

98,Chick from snapchat tries to scam using NDP?,11,6,23/11/2021,"I've been talking with this cute chick from close by location whom I matched up with on Tinde, later asked for snapchat and at first it was going good until she mentioned NDP. She said it's something to do with protection for girls and stands for Noondark Dating Protection. According to her she has been abused on dates like 8 years ago so she wanted protection and found that website. 
So later she sent me a link to sign up, which was fishy af so I googled stuff relating to that and found DAP (Dating Arrangement Protection) which is similar to that NDP website.

So I immediately came to realise something is wrong. One of the website has appropriate certificates but other one doesn't have any. Everything is legitimately similar on both the websites except for the domain name and the text besides logo ;_; 

Also, after further investigation, I found that Tinder has something similar but only in U.S called Noon Light but that's built into the app, I suppose?

Anyways, I ain't gonna fuck with her, just wanted to inform you guys.

99,"Paid for tinder gold, bought a boost, got no likes/matches, and then was banned",11,21,16/02/2022,"I’m beginning to get frustrated. I bought Tinder gold a week ago, and used the Boost. Got 9 likes, matched with maybe one, did not talk to her. Yesterday, I bought a boost, got no likes at all. This morning I open Tinder and I’m banned.

My profile has looked the same for a year. One shirtless beach pic (lead photo), one of me playing basketball, two “portrait style” with me just smiling and looking at the camera, and a couple group photos. All photos show my face, there is nothing explicit/rude, no drugs, or anything illegal. Even the shirtless beach pic is literally me standing on a rock by the water and waving. 

My bio says my height, that I’m a doctor, and a bit about my personality - nothing that could possibly be construed as rude, illegal, or disrespectful. The only change I made from the previous boost to this one was to my bio, where I said, “Swipe left if asking for money or just looking for ig followers.” Ive had no conversations with any matches within the past couple weeks (since I redownloaded the app after my relationship ended). None of the conversations were arguments, insults, or really anything I could think of that would lead to a ban.

Ive never been banned from Tinder before and I literally feel like Tinder just robbed me and there is absolutely no explanation or anything I can do to even get an answer. I paid for a service with the same account setup I’ve always had, got absolutely nothing out of that service, and was subsequently banned. Any perspectives? Is what I added to my bio really that offensive?

101,"I recently returned to Tinder after a long haitus and had my spirits crushed almost immediately. [21, M, UK]",11,9,28/06/2021,"I was surprised by how many matches I got within the first couple of days. Ultimately most of those didn't respond or the conversation just fizzled out. But then I had found a couple of women where things were seemingly going well:

With one I had multiple shared interests and we had good conversations over the course of a few days until we met up. Overall what we talked about in person was a continuation of our conversations over Tinder and Snapchat. For me it had been a long while since I'd been in the dating realm so I was a bit nervous and I think she sensed that, but I had been perfectly open about this beforehand and when we'd discussed it she was perfectly understanding. I left feeling cautiously optimistic, tasked with letting her know I got home safe. I did and minutes later realised she had blocked me on Snapchat and unmatched on Tinder, no explanation given.

The second match wasn't really based on common interests but on our sense of humour and banter. Things were going fairly well. She then requested more pictures of myself. I explained that I only really have older pictures, I haven't really taken any since lockdown began last year and that my current hairstyle was different to the old pics. But it was still clearly me, there was no way I could be confused as a catfish or anything like that. Sure the newer photos weren't as high quality (my current phone has a horrendous quality camera and my old pics were taken in the dimmer, more flattering lighting of a bar whereas the new ones were taken in my flat (all of this explained to her prior)) but there was no way of confusing the two as photos of different people or as purposely misleading. But, alas, blocked on Snapchat, unmatched on Tinder. I reached out politely over Instagram where I wasn't yet blocked to try and gain an understanding of what the problem was, is it something I can improve, etc, only to be met with ""K"" as the only response.

It's worth mentioning I am 21 and these matches were 21 and 20, both in university. I have seen other comments on the sub of men who have endured similar occurances of matches around this age with women at university. Is this is some sort of cultural norm now? Is this what I have to look forward to with the rest of my time on Tinder? I hardly seem to have much choice. I assumed my age group to be mature enough adults but apparently that was too much to hope for. Plus anyone over 25 always seems to respond with the token patronising response of ""Aw, you're just a baby, lol"" when they find out I'm the lickle baby age of 21, fresh out of the womb. And then there's people advertising their OnlyFans and there's 'cam model' scammers.

102,You know why people try to catfish you on Tinder even when they intend to meet you in person? Wondering what the end game is? It's that they are hoping that the sunk cost fallacy will make you want to continue with the date.,11,6,27/07/2022,"People keep asking this question so I thought I would make a post that answers it once and for all.

For those of you who don't know what the sunk cost fallacy is:

The sunk cost fallacy occurs when a person continues to invest in something merely because they have already invested quite a bit into it even when it is clear that continuing to invest in that thing is not in their interests.

104,First date on Valenditne's day (stupid),10,3,08/03/2018,"So I am extremely busy. I run, a lot. So I plan my dates around my training... Well I planned a date with this guy, lets call him Bob. I planned a date with Bob, and it just happened to be on Valentine's day. No big deal if neither of us really cared.

So Bob gets to the place early to make sure we get a table, which leads me to get ready early and also show up early. I text Bob I was on my way. So I get there and it's crowded... great. I look around, don't see him, I ask a host if they have either his name or mine, none. I ask if there has been a gentleman dining alone for the last 45 minutes now, they said only the regular that dines alone. Not him. 

In this time I have called him twice and text him a few times, so after 20 minutes I leave. Luckily a girl I know invited me to go out and hang out with her and we ended up having a blast. Well I didn't eat dinner, because I was supposed to eat dinner with Bob... So I'm starving and I've had a little to drink so I text this guy my friends call Noodle to see if he wanted to meet up to get dinner. Noodle agrees and we ended up eating dinner at one of the most expensive restaurants in the city because ooops, we forgot it was Valentine's day so Happy Hour doesn't exist. 

So the next day I am woken up at 430 am by a text from Bob saying ""I was told I had a seizure"" and sends me a ""picture of him in the hospital. I didn't respond because at this point I don't buy it. It took me 10 minutes to get there, the picture wasn't in an over night room, he didn't have his phone last night, but he magically has it at 4:30 am... Bob has bitten the dust to me.

107,Chinese Tinder scammer,10,7,20/03/2022,"I want to report a cryptocurrency romance scam. At the end of January this year, I met a Chinese man named Zhang Bowen through Tinder. He told me that he had arrived in Peru from Brazil and that he was quarantining at the Costa del Sol hotel at the airport. Chatting on Tinder, he asked me what I was looking for in the application, as it was the first time I used Tinder, I told him I was looking for something casual, he told me he was looking for a serious relationship, to which I replied that I was not looking for that and that when I finished his quarantine invited him to go trekking, he told me that he thought it was fine and asked me for my number so he could write me on WhatsApp.

&#x200B;

He wrote to me on WhatsApp, the whole conversation was in English, he wrote fluently in English and I used the translator. He started asking me about my life, my hobbies, how much I earned. Later, he told me that he was a single father, that his daughter had stayed in China with his parents, he sent me videos of him with his daughter and with his parents. He had come to my country to open a Chinese food restaurant and that he would be doing business here for several years. After a few days of conversation, he encouraged me to invest in cryptocurrencies, assuring that he was an expert and that trading was his second income.

&#x200B;

On the first investment I made a profit that I was able to withdraw. With that investment he gained my trust, he began to call me wife, he had put together a novel of a future together, which included travel, luxurious life, children. I was not excited about that, I was only encouraged by the idea of ​​learning to invest in cryptocurrencies. Also, he sent me photos, stickers and videos of sexual content, he asked me to do the same, I shared my intimate photos and videos where my face was seen. I made a couple of video calls and he only answered one where everything was dark and noise was heard around him, he seemed strange to me and he told me he was listening to music.

&#x200B;

The second time I invested with a leverage of 20 times what I was investing, in the end I obtained a profit of almost $30,000 usd, with that investment the platform asked me to pay 20% of my profit and that I only had 48 hours to pay, after If I paid, my account would be unfrozen and I would be able to withdraw the money. I did not have the money, I asked the Chinese to pay it and that I was going to pay him back when I received my earnings, he told me that it was a lot of money and that he supported me with $2,000 usd, the rest I had to get on my own. . I got the money with the loans that five banks gave me, when the Chinese had to deposit the part that he had promised, it was only $227 usd, he told me that he had reached the transaction limit in his accounts and since they were from China he could not do anything.

&#x200B;

In the end, I got the money that was missing, I paid the tax and my account was unfrozen, I tried to withdraw my earnings but it was not possible because the account was frozen again, I checked on the platform and they told me that the Chinese deposit was considered as money laundering of money and that I had to pay $4,888 again to unfreeze my account and that they would return that money to me. I did not accept to pay, before I had my suspicions that it was a scam but at this point I just realized. The Chinese told me that he should pay some minimum amount to request a term until he finishes his quarantine and that when he came out he was going to help me pay. I did not accept and the Chinese man became aggressive, he told me that he was not going to help me and that the best thing was for me to commit suicide.

&#x200B;

The scam made me lose $6,500 usd and I have to pay monthly loan installments. I'm in a deep depression because my career is all about technology and I was supposed to know about these scams. I'm going to start psychiatric treatment and I'm trying to find freelance jobs. It doesn't end there...

&#x200B;

Watching videos about scams on youtube, I discovered that you can do a reverse search of photos, I searched for two weeks and found nothing, I left it for a week and then I found on the internet a page that I searched in several browsers at the same time, in a browser that He is not very well known. I found the photo of the Chinese on dating sites in Russia and China, on each page he had a different Asian name and nationality. I kept looking and found several profiles on Instagram, Facebook, LinkedIn.

&#x200B;

Finally, in one of the Instagram profiles where he had uploaded a couple of posts about cryptocurrencies, a user wrote that it was false and implied that he should stop impersonating the Chinese actor Liu Mingxiong, this actor is not well known but he is He knows that his photos and videos are used to scam women around the world.

109,Young Chinese girls on tinder,10,10,18/09/2021,"Hi, did you notice the many accounts of beautiful Chinese girls on Tinder claiming to be in Europe?
They asked me some questions, then are quick to move to WhatsApp.

One girl who called herself Salsa had her phone number from the US California, but when asked, she said she studies in Glasgow. I asked her why does she have an American phone number if she studied in Scotland (she's supposed to be in Prague to open up a Chinese restaurant according to her). Then she said she studied in Boston and transferred to Glasgow (Boston ≠ Cali haha).

None of the above make any sense of course, major scam / hacker vibes. Asked her for a selfie - of course I got a Photoshopped pic that wasn't taken on the spot. Read online that it's a new problem on Tinder, and wondered what do you think?

We talked for 4 days, nothing like a scam showed up. Then she asked when I was available to meet up. Score. 

Well after we determine a time and place she then asked if I had my gsa. I was like what is that? I couldn't Google anything relevant so I assumed it was some new slang or mistyped word. 
She kept trying to explain what it was and I was like just gimme a link, let's see the scam. 
She sends me an email, to a spam email I setup just just such occasions, and I take a gander. The site looks legit to the untrained eye. But I work in IT and am skeptical to begin with. I dig into the site, it's an anonymous owner originating in Amsterdam that has only been online for less than 6 months. All red flags.

124,SH claims from a catfish?,9,5,17/10/2022,"Post removed from r/Tinder, so posting here.

One fine day I got a match on Tinder. The match seemed to be a quite pretty girl around my age, and I started the conversation. The conversation went very well, to the point she wanted to meet up with me (This was around a day after the match). I was kinda glad that someone would like to meet up with me as well, as I was getting bored and wanted to meet new people. Her location was showing ""less than a kilometre"" on her profile, so that's an added bonus. We decided that we would meet up and go to a mall around 15-20 mins away from our location (it's a pretty popular mall at my city where most young couples just go to hang out and eat at the food court).

Even though everything was going fine, I felt something very off about this. I searched up her name of FB and Insta, but no results whatsoever. That felt extremely strange, why would any woman, on this day and age, not have any socials (I mean it's entirely possible, but such a pretty girl is very highly unlikely to have no socials at all). And moreover, her Tinder profile is not verified (I discovered this after I asked for her socials).

I asked her casually if she has any socials, she replied she's on Telegram, and then promptly added that she isn't the girl in the picture. My suspicions were getting stronger, what tf does she mean by that, and why Telegram? I pinged her on telegram asked her to send a picture of her holding a note, saying some random keyword on it that I suggested. She was very reluctant to do that, and my suspicion rose higher. She sent one picture of the note, but only with her hand on it, and no face. Nothing was helping her cause, and (I know I'm dumb) I should have unmatched and blocked her right there and then.

After an awkward discussion about her reluctance to verify her identity, and me almost giving up on the match, we eventually agreed to meet up and see each other in person. Next day came, and I was very nervous about what would happen. Part of me wished that she wouldn't show up and I would unmatch her right there, and part of me was also curious to know who is behind the profile. I also called one of my friends to the mall to come and watch us from afar so that I don't fall into any trouble. Eventually the time came for me to meet up, I went to the mall and pinged her to know if she was coming. She replied 'No' and that's when I unmatched and blocked her.

Also, why I am still saying 'she' is because at one point in our conversation, she was occassionally sending voice recordings of her replies, and it was clearly a woman's voice. Still she is a catfish because she is masquerading as someone who clearly is not her.

My major takeaways and lessons from this incident is:

\- Never get in touch with a profile with no socials, and if no socials, at least they should be verified.

\- Whenever you get the slightest hint you are dealing with a catfish, do not continue the conversation further. No meetups, no video calls, or anything.

\- If you get a match that seems too good to be true, try to check their socials (And this is in no way an encouragement to stalking, stalking is completely different than verifying).

Now my question to you guys is: Should I be worried about any sexual harassment claim from her for asking for her verification picture? How likely am I going to be screwed? As proof, I have screenshots of the conversation, and I never asked for anything lewd or inappropriate, just a selfie of herself holding the note.",catfish,post removed r tinder posting here one fine day got match tinder match seemed quite pretty girl around age started conversation conversation went well point wanted meet this around day match kin the glad someone would like meet well getting bored wanted meet new people location showing less kilometre profile that s added bonus decided would meet go mall around mins away location it s pretty popular mall city young couples go hang eat food court even though everything going fine felt something this searched name fb insta results whatsoever felt extremely strange would woman day age socials i mean entirely possible pretty girl highly unlikely socials all moreover tinder profile verified i discovered asked socials asked casually socials replied telegram promptly added girl picture suspicions getting stronger tf mean that telegram pinged telegram asked send picture holding note saying random keyword suggested reluctant that suspicion rose higher sent one picture note hand it face nothing helping cause i know i m dumb unmatched blocked right then awkward discussion reluctance verify identity almost giving match eventually agreed meet see person next day came nervous would happen part wished show would unmatch right there part also curious know behind profile also called one friends mall come watch us afar fall trouble eventually time came meet up went mall pinged know coming replied no that s unmatched blocked her also still saying she one point conversation occassionally sending voice recordings replies clearly woman s voice still catfish masquerading someone clearly her major takeaways lessons incident is never get touch profile socials socials least verified whenever get slightest hint dealing catfish continue conversation further meetups video calls anything get match seems good true try check socials and way encouragement stalking stalking completely different verifying question guys is worried sexual harassment claim asking verification picture likely going screwed proof screenshots conversation never asked anything lewd inappropriate selfie holding note,sh claims catfish
125,Is photofeeler a scam?,9,22,18/01/2019,"Here are my reasons to think so:

1. Bloody expensive. It is 100 credits for 20$. Which means 10 votes on 10 pictures, 100 votes on 1 picture, or 20 votes on 5 pictures. 10 votes is nothing, 20 is close to nothing too. This price would be reasonable, if you were to compare professionally-taken photographs by a professional photographer. But, most people who use online dating websites, don't want to throw their money into professional photographs, and it is quite too expensive to compare 10's, or even 100's, of selfies and photos from holidays.
2. That tutorials suggesting to ""experiment"" a lot and ""try another pose"", etc. Even the notes feature, where everything is turned into ""try another pose"" ""try another expression"" or ""try another clothes"", by the moderators.
3. There are no non-sponsored articles about it on the internet. The only thing I've found, was a reddit poster looking for an alternative.
4. Voters will want free votes, so will vote without care - the same vote on every picture, and will vote something else only if it catches their eye.

So, I would say it is a scam. What do you think?",scam,reasons think so bloody expensive credits means votes pictures votes picture votes pictures votes nothing close nothing too price would reasonable compare professionally taken photographs professional photographer but people use online dating websites want throw money professional photographs quite expensive compare s even s selfies photos holidays tutorials suggesting experiment lot try another pose etc even notes feature everything turned try another pose try another expression try another clothes moderators non sponsored articles internet thing i ve found reddit poster looking alternative voters want free votes vote without care vote every picture vote something else catches eye so would say scam think,photofeeler scam

I don't understand how men are so horny that they would invite a total stranger over to their home or ask if they can come to someone else's, like I could easily kill or rob you if I wanted to but I don't think most guys even think about that.

However, this is completely different for women because assault and going to a strangers house is scary as hell, so why do men think it's ok? Like two messages into a conversation after we just matched you want to come over to my house, like I don't know you. 

Like it's ridiculous how easy men are, not to sl*t shame them or anything though but your safety should come before a hookup and maybe if you wanna hook up with someone get to know them more, the hookup might even be more enjoyable.",assault,i m f college town central texas dating scene pretty wide diverse matter guys think ok ask women come hook ask come mine use participate hookup culture anymore always made sure get know guy first guys make sooo hard understand men horny would invite total stranger home ask come someone else s like could easily kill rob wanted think guys even think that however completely different women assault going strangers house scary hell men think ok like two messages conversation matched want come house like know you like ridiculous easy men are sl t shame anything though safety come hookup maybe wanna hook someone get know more hookup might even enjoyable,stranger danger even exist anymore

So tonight I decided to renew my plus membership, guess what the flow changed completely abruptly, from seeing only good-looking girls to ugly and less attractive girls or girls who use the passport and are 1000 km away and also a lot of fake profiles. After 20 swipes, the classic message came ""there is no person nearby”.

CONFESSIONS OF A PERSON WITH A FETISH FOR

-BEING IGNORED WHILE YOU GIVE YOUR PARTNER HEAD

-OBSESSION WITH INSPECTING THE MOUTH, THROAT, TONSILS WITH FINGERS. (no washing)

-BIG “80s” BUSH

- OBSESSED WITH CUM TALKING ABOUT CUM, SWALLOWING CUM, ETC.

Ideal Date (in this person’s eyes)

Part 1 : BE POLITE, ASSERTIVE AND TRADITIONAL 
-hold the door
-hold hand
-pay for drinks
-engage in conversation
-lean in and whisper “Well, you know the deal, I'll get your drinks if you get my cum.""
-give/offer a jacket when cold and outside

Part 2 : CRASS BEHAVIOR 

Make disrespectful slurping noises while having drinks

Lean in and ask “so can we talk about my cum for a second?”

Be Pushy about scheduling another date ASAP during the first date

-""we definitely need to grab drinks again. get out your phone, let's book something for tuesday, ok?""

-""I'd like to take you to dinner next time, so that means head before and after, assuming ur cool with that? I’ll schedule you in for Wednesday at 8:00 PM for _____ restaurant.”

""FYI, I am taking ur phone because I reserve the right for a third round tonight if I feel like it, so it may not be just two, just being upfront.""

“I’m not even sure I want to be exclusive with you. It’ll make you work harder to please me

“asking my address in case u feel it necessary to run me over a small container of ur cum before the next time i see you!”

Part 3 : HEAD

Tips for acting disinterested in the head

-DEMAND YOU TAKE THEIR TELEPHONE FIRST AND TURN IT OFF
-Ignore them
-play the synth
-mix music
-read Kafka

Inspect their mouth to make sure it’s clean, reach around with your fingers, and into their throat. Play with tonsils and tongue is a must.

I love it when guys say ""get that cum"" almost like they're dsaying ""get that ball"" at a baseball or basketball game

""nice job getting that cum""

“Ugh, are you still going?” “Lol, you’re going to have to try harder to get that cum.”

“Ugh, I’m probably going to have to put on headphones”

Roll your eyes in disappointment

""How is it you were so interesting over drinks and so boring right now with a cock in your mouth?” 

“I can’t believe how boring this head is.”

“Come on, You can go deeper than that.”

“Focus on the cum.”

Escalate angrily

""Can you stop the fucking slurping for a fewminutes while i finish this project?""

""Finally cumming!” Then one is supposed to come into the throat and check to make sure they swallow it all.

147,"PSA: Watch out for girls from Tinder who like fashion, hiking, investing and other random things.",8,9,11/11/2019,"Girls (mostly from Hong Kong) will play the very long game of leading you to believe they have an inside tip about a new crypto.

151,A Scam To Watch Out For,8,5,30/08/2016,"I matched with someone three days ago and sent them a simple message, and then noticed that they said to message them on Kik if we matched. I sent another message on Kik half convinced it would just be a bot, but sure enough they responded a day later. We had a bit of small talk about the area, what they do, what I do, things like that. Then they asked why I'm on Tinder and if I'm single.

They then asked if I would go to a website and ""vote"" for her, saying that I would have to put in credit card information to 'validate the vote'. Of course I knew this was bullshit, but I took the link and looked around a bit.

The first link she gave was shortened, so I asked for a full link. The second link went through a site called Ninjas Chat Club, and seemed to direct to an account. If I type in the domain normally, it directly links to another page on a domain called xchatrooms.wiredcircular. A dig into whois revealed that the site uses credit card information to subscribe people to multiple sites, and one person even posted saying that the girls there weren't real girls and were stealing her modeling pictures and using them as bait.

But here's the real kicker: I got into a full on argument with this person about the site, their legitimacy, and even convinced them to send me a picture with my name and the date written on a sheet of paper. Of course, the picture was photoshopped, but it was done extremely well.

These are real people putting effort into scamming you, personalizing messages and even attempting to harass you as an individual if you show any resistance. If you run into one of these 'girls' that want you to 'vote' for them, do yourself a favor and just report them.

154,Stranger Wants Money,7,0,06/05/2019,"Want to hear about the last time I went on Tinder in hopes of actually finding a relationship? This is a really long story so settle in. TLDR at the bottom. I had tried Tinder a number of times, usually after I discover that a girl I liked had a boyfriend. Even after all of the obvious catfish and being sent links to porn and cam sites. (Seriously, if I wanted to go to a porn site, I’d go to one myself.) Yet time and again, I come back.
Now, this happened roughly a year ago. Long story short, a girl in my college biology class, also my lab partner, gets a boyfriend. Joy. After a few weeks of moping, I tried Tinder for probably the 15th time. I go through my usual series of unrequited right swipes when I match with this girl.
She wasn’t drop dead gorgeous, but she was cute enough. I started chatting with her and actually responded. (This happened a year ago, so my memory is a bit rusty. This is my best recollection of the conversation.)

Me: Hey. What’s up?
Her: Okay. In the hospital.
Me: Oh man. You okay?
Her: Yeah.
Me: Anything interesting happen otherwise?
Her: No.

I am really bad at keeping a conversation going, especially when I have to come up with the topics. This girl was not helping. The awkward conversation continues.

Me: You see any good movies lately?
Her: Emoji Movie
Me: Haven’t seen that one yet.
Her: It’s a great movie.
(For real?)
Me: I’ll have to check it out sometime.
Her: You should.
(Not a chance.)

After awkwardly chatting for a while, I decided maybe it would be better if we meet up in person.

Me: So, you want to meet up for lunch sometime in the near future?
Her: Well, I can’t really afford anything.
Me: I can pay for your meal. I’m inviting you.
Her: Ok.

So, I made a lunch date, or at least a chance to know her before I ask her out for real. Then she tells me...

Her: I have a favor.
Me: Go ahead.
Her: My phone is about to get shut off. Can I borrow $45 from you? I’ll pay you back.

Is this chick seriously asked me for money? With no way to guarantee of her actually paying me back, and being fed up with catfish, I finish the conversation with this.

Me: Look, I don’t know you. I never lend money to someone I don’t know. 
Her: Ok.
Me: You know what? Forget I said anything about meeting up for lunch. For future reference, it’s probably not very smart to ask guys on Tinder, or really any dating sites for money.
Her: Ok.

I deleted my account and the app from my phone. For real this time, I was done with Tinder. I held to what I said to this day. But the story didn’t end there.
A few weeks later, I went over to Wendy’s for lunch. I ordered my usual 10 piece nugget meal (100 times better than McNuggets btw.) Now guess who I see working behind the counter. Yep. Tinder girl. She obviously recognized me. She was acting all flirting with me, making “I want you” faces and calling me “honey” and “sweetie.” I was polite, but made it obvious I wasn’t going to fall for her little tricks.

This guy texts me, apparently thinking I’m his boss (same first name I guess) who he thinks is working remotely. The first text is saying he has not received some extra pay from work, the following texts are his last 3 pay stubs with all his information on it. 

I first thought it was a scam text, as there’s a lot of them going around, but he starts the text with his first and last name, and it shows his work place and city/state. 
I googled to check the name and the search popped up a Facebook page. I realized who it was and pondered whether to respond.

Good thing I’m not vindictive. I wanted to ignore it, but my husband said it would be nice of me to not leave it on read and let him know he had the wrong number.

my next move, i send her my phone nr. because i didnt wane it to go to assfuck me again. but again no responce soo i started waiting again, but this time just one day. then i logged in on PC thinking it could work better there. (my phone google pixel 4) i send my nr. again. 20min later a get message notification on my phone, I went to check it out seeing it was from her. ""clicked it"" The chat opend but there was no new text just the one i sent last, Kinda confused i looked at it and then the chated close and the match is gone. (on my end atleast)

Now it gets kinda stalky but dont blame me its more the trash app tinder that makes you feel like a pieces of shit.

I saw befor the match was gone, her name and how far she was from my locaiton.(pretty close) she alsow was kinda a hippi, just like me.  
hippies have a lot of the same friends. and i went to instagram and serched her name. and what do you know i found her. after she followed me back i asked her on the insta messanger if she deleted the match or if it was a problem on my end. again after a few minutes i get an answer and a screen shot that our match is still there for her and even the message that she sent last and i didnt get.

so conclusion dont trust the tinder messanger and get the phone nr. instagram name or any other form of contacting your matches beacause you never know if tinder just deletes it.

Has this happend to somebody else? or am I a fucking retard?",scam,heeey fellow gamers tinder scam read right ok nobody believe stay moment match cute girl started texting three messages later get responce pretty quick back forth texts loged app didnt think much it next days get answer decied ask got message relog idk maby fuck it soon gets back me saying didnt get anything last text means didnt send all even though went end next move send phone nr didnt wane go assfuck again responce soo started waiting again time one day logged pc thinking could work better there my phone google pixel send nr again min later get message notification phone went check seeing her clicked it chat opend new text one sent last kin the confused looked chated close match gone on end atleast gets kin the stalky dont blame trash app tinder makes feel like pieces shit saw befor match gone name far locaiton pretty close alsow kin the hippi like me hippies lot friends went instagram serched name know found her followed back asked insta messanger deleted match problem end minutes get answer screen shot match still even message sent last didnt get conclusion dont trust tinder messanger get phone nr instagram name form contacting matches beacause never know tinder deletes it happend somebody else fucking retard,tinder deletes matches and prove

196,AliExpress Tinder Swindler Daniel Amil,6,3,16/07/2022,"I want to share a scammer story that happened in Portugal last week.   


  
The guy in the picture was my hangout from the CS. He borrowed and still did not return money from me. After investigating the case myself, I've found a few more victims of him. In total, he collected more than $5000 from all. Please don't judge; I am trying to prevent similar stories in the future.  
He calls himself Daniel Amil (lion) V F, originally from Iran; the family moved to the United Kingdom; he studied medicine but switched to IT (cyber security). A salsa dancer, played poker, and did Jujutsu in the past. In general, keep speaking about how smart he is about properties in Alicante, Spain, and investing. His victims are from the CS, Badoo, and Tinder.  
Has 3 tattoos: a dragon on the left calf, a sign of ace on the left wrist, and the sentence on the left shoulder blade.  
His tearing story: get robbed by 2 Franch ladies on the train, don't have the cards with himself and can transfer the money to your account for the cash in return. The reason there are the troubles with the payment- is he needs to be fiscally in the bank with a new passport and can not do it as in France now.  
Before he had been to Spain, Lisbon, Portugal, currently should be in Toulouse or around France. Please be careful if you know him- kindly help to learn more about his identity.

205,Suspicious asian accounts popping up on my Tinder,5,10,27/02/2022,"I recently got a match from a supermodel-looking asian model with an Italian (of all things) name. Obviously I realised it was some kind of scam or catfish for one reason or another, but I tried to talk to them and played dumb just to see what the deal was about. The conversation was reasonably normal, and after wondering whether I'd be down to go out in about a month or so they asked for my WhatsApp, to which I responded with hesitancy (regarding giving out my phone number). Since I didn't get a response afterwards, I figured that was that and soon forgot about it.  


Until another very similar account cropped up, and once again they have a European name (Bulgarian this time) with the same supermodel-tier pictures. For the sake of sheer curiosity I've gone ahead and matched, but before I get the chance to sus them out myself: has anyone else had something similar happen recently? I did some Googling and reddit-searching and found threads about similar things from about a year ago, but the answers weren't clear-cut and I am really curious what others have to say on it.

Anyway i matched with a handsome man today. Started talking and he was really sweet. We talked about what's going on in our lives etc. I'm newly single trying to make ends meet and would never consider having a sugar daddy. Well this is where it goes left. The guy was so adamant about wiring me some money and i said sure why not surely he wouldn't scam someone who's broke like what's he gonna get from me a food stamp?   


So i give him my account number and my full name. Shortly after i gave him my information he's saying that there's an issue with his account and i need to purchase a gift card (didn't quite understand how that would work) so he can use his crypto account to wire the money. That's when i knew it was a scam. Called him out and got blocked immediately.  


I live in Europe and already called my bank and they basically said there's nothing he can do with my information especially since there's basically no money to go after. However it freaked me the hell out.  


Moral of the story is don't get suckered into something that seems to good to be true. A handsome man wanting to help you a bit is most likely going to be a scam.

224,Is this shady? Or am I overthinking?,5,24,13/07/2021,"So, I (27F) matched with this really good looking guy (27M) about 69 miles away from me. I matched using Gold, and honestly, I normally would not give a guy more than 25 miles from me the time of day, but this guy was...oof.

And the first thing he said to me was not come to my house to cuddle *wink*, or your leggings would look good on my floor ( both of which I've gotten), so this was already starting out pretty good. His account is verified, which I don't know if that actually means anything? Like how accurate is that?

But anyways, he asks for extra pics, which I assume it's so he can verify I'm not a catfish. So, he asks for my snapchat, but I don't have one because I'm just not that into social media or constantly taking photos or videos of myself. My Facebook and Instagram have not been updated in I know like over 6 months. I'm just not that into it. I tell him I don't have one, but we can exchange numbers or video chat. He asks me again to send him a pic, which I don't mind, but I don't think he knew you can't send pics via Tinder. So, I tell him that little fact since he completely avoided my initial suggestions of exchanging numbers or videochatting. Then he asks me to make a snapchat and I'm like...wtf?

My spidey senses start tingling. What's his endgame here? I get not necessarily wanting to videochat someone you don't know. But what about the number thing? Is he just trying to get nudes without giving his personal number, or is he just super cautious about giving out his number? Like women are. Is he a catfish despite being verified?

I know you guys obviously can't answer that, but am I right to think something is off here? Should I even bother making a snapchat I won't use?",catfish,so f matched really good looking guy m miles away me matched using gold honestly normally would give guy miles time day guy was oof first thing said come house cuddle wink leggings would look good floor i ve gotten already starting pretty good account verified know actually means anything like accurate that anyways asks extra pics assume verify i m catfish so asks snapchat one i m social media constantly taking photos videos myself facebook instagram updated know like months i m it tell one exchange numbers video chat asks send pic mind think knew can t send pics via tinder so tell little fact since completely avoided initial suggestions exchanging numbers videochatting asks make snapchat i m like wtf spidey senses start tingling what s endgame here get necessarily wanting videochat someone know number thing trying get nudes without giving personal number super cautious giving number like women are catfish despite verified know guys obviously can t answer that right think something here even bother making snapchat use,shady overthinking

Anyone using Windows 8/10 can download 6tin from the App store. It's the unofficial Tinder app for Windows. Usually you would download this if you had a Windows phone, but you can still use the app on your desktop. So anyone that thinks they have an issue with the official phone app can try this method instead. I haven't experienced any crashing. A nice feature is you can right click on a picture and Google Image search to verify if it's a catfish. Gif searching works. You can also save pickup lines so you just perform a couple of clicks to insert your favorite.

234,I think a lot of you guys got it all wrong (my theory on tinder use),5,7,08/11/2017,"This post isn't about trying to get laid. Honestly, don't act just like you are trying to get laid. That doesn't mean don't be sexual. But women have to deal with constantly getting sexualized on tinder so save the ""let me sit on your face openers"" (i mean seriously wtf is even the point of doing that) 

Now, I don't know how tinder stats generally play out, but for reference I have over 2000 matches and have only ever used tinder as a way to meet people. I got it in the summer going into 10th grade (back when minors could use it) and am now almost 19 and a freshman in uni. 


I'm not a super good looking guy, but not too bad either. My main downside is that I am very skinny (5'11"" and ~110 lbs.) I have used tinder for a number of hookups, and had multiple relationships from it, including my current one which I am very happy about. I am no expert in tinder, but I see a lot of people who are over hyping every interaction and I don't see that as producing a positive outcome. 


I can only really comment on tinder usage in my age group, so young people. 


It seems like the main problem people have here is that they overthink how they should communicate with their matches and that limits them from finding what they really want. Tinder isn't some digital bar where the guys compete to see who has the suavest pickup line. Tinder is about exploring and experimenting with the human psyche. Try things out, experiment. Ask interesting and entreating questions about the human experience. Be open and humble. Don't force interaction with a match because you feel the need to. You have the opportunity to meet many more people than you otherwise would. At least for me, I literally have never once in my life gone and hit on a girl in public, or at a party or anything. Tinder isn't a way for me to simulate that, it's a way to circumvent it. 



*if you just act like a thoughtful, caring, interesting person people will like you*

On tinder you cast a wide net. If you live in a densely populated area it should't be hard to get matches. Don't catfish someone, but also choose good pictures of yourself. It's about getting the foot in the door for the largest amount of people. 



I personally have generally right swiped on everyone then unmatched people I wasn't interested in. But that's just because I'm lazy and don't really see a purpose in focusing too heavily on initial selections. I have read that the algorithm may lower the tinder elo if your profile if you do this so do whatever works best with you in terms of swiping. 

Heres the only piece of advice I could really give: be yourself.

I know that sounds cliche, and at least with me I am a very intellectual person (not saying I'm intelligent, I just like talking about random shit over small talk) Whether or not a girl can talk to me about something completely different than what is expected is the majority of how I choose to meet someone. I have also found that nearly every girl I have ever gotten to know from tinder has told me that I stood out from the crowd because they felt that I was being open and honest. 

Most girls (at least attractive young ones) don't take tinder seriously. Don't treat it like you're chatting up some cutie at a bar. It is not the same environment so why would the same things be applicable? 


You are an individual in a sea of dicks. You have to stand out. 


My current girlfriend suggested meeting me after I had a really personal conversation with her about mental health. She told me that me talking to her about that, opening up, was attractive. This is obviously a selection bias but don't you want someone that you can be open with. 


If you aren't vibing with someone, they don't get your jokes, they don't have anything interesting to say, move on. 


Also I have been reading around and seeing that dudes are talking to girls exclusively on tinder for weeks if not longer. Don't do this. Tinder has a shitty UX compared to other apps, and why would you want to talk to her on the platform where guys are constantly hitting her up and being gross. I'm sure most girls have a sort of negative association with tinder messages. and they also probably have notifications off. As soon as you have an extended conversation with the person, or short ones over a day or two, ask for snapchat or her number. Most people IME won't have a problem giving it out, and if they do that probably means they aren't interested. 


Being able to deeply connect with someone quickly is why I love tinder. You have a platform that has very low risk for expressing yourself. So do so. 

I am open to hearing feedback. 

Other people probably do tinder much better than me. Honestly I talk to most of my matches just to learn about personalities and their lives.

I was now two days in Germany travelling by train and I got ""easily"" three likes, and from the two I wrote, both replied ma back. Also the girls look much more local than in Switzerland. 

Also I'd like to mention that I get likes easily and start chattig is easy even in Switzerland, when I use the same profile pictures / Info but with other dating apps. (e.g. Badoo)

256,Should I tell him I have gapped teeth?,4,14,13/06/2022,"Soo i recently matched with this cute guy and we’re planning to see each other tomorrow… 
I think I look pretty much like my pictures on tinder lol I’m not a catfish but it’s been 2 months since I had a palate expander and it created a gap between my two front teeth. I personally don’t like it and feel a bit insecure about it too. 
I was wondering if I should tell him before hand that my smile has changed (all the pics I put on my tinder are with my « old » original smile which I loved 🥲 anyways) or should I just not mention it and don’t say anything during the date? 

I know it might sound like a bit of a dumb question but having gapped teeth is a big change for me hahaha and I’m not lovin it lemme tell you.

And I'm not talking about using a one-year-old photo of yourself when you've gained a bit of weight / lost a bit of muscle, or have a different haircut / color or so, those are acceptable, especially if you don't have many photos of yourself and you consider them good ones. I'm talking about uploading a picture of yourself when you were 18 and in the best shape of your life but now you're 24-25 and are like 20-25 kg overweight. Or you upload a pic when you were 25, rock climbing, toned body, bursting with energy but you're 30, lost most of your hair and your hobbies are now watching Netflix and downing beer, and you have the body to show for it.

265,Possible experiment idea?,4,3,27/08/2019,"It's pretty popular seeing a catfishing ""woman"" or nude sellers/nude streamers trying to stalk out your credit card on tinder. Are there any women that see this same thing on Tinder when they match with men? If so, how often do you see it? I'd say out of every 10-20 women on tinder I swipe through, there's usually at least one catfish or seller. And when I actually get matches that number turns into like 1-5 catfishes or sellers. Is this something common among women too? For men to try selling nudes? I would assume not, but I mean who knows. What about catfishers? I kind of categorize catfishers and sellers together because 9 times out of 10 a nude seller is still a catfish.

Just curious,

266,Tinder is a psychological cash scam,4,9,27/02/2018,"Ok that headline is a little dramatic but I was an early tinder user and I recall a time when tinder was so “organic” that you could out somewhere to a bar or club and then the next day you’d see some of the same girls from that spot in your queue. You sort of “netted” people as you went about your day. 

Nowadays, the algorithmic first approach of the app makes it apparent that true customer value is no longer the main priority, but rather using the algorithm to drive more revenue - understandably so. Here’s what I mean:

Nowadays I simply no longer get attractive matches on the app. I used to match with a range of 7s-9s, but since the beginning of 2017 my exposure to more attractive women has plummeted. I state this as fact because using tinder gold, the ONLY women I see that liked me already are literally all under 6s. 90% of are “larger” women. When Gold first came out and they wanted to get people hooked on the feature, i was seeing 7s+ already like me and I could just choose to match - I loved it. Those days are over and now tinder clearly only shows profile to women I’m not attracted to. It’s not an elo=elo score exposure approach that everyone raves about. 

TLDR: I feel like grandfathered accounts are flagged as high value prospects for premium features (revenue). Meaning if they continue to only give you options you’re not satisfied with, you’ll continue to use the app and continue to pay for paid features. I truly believe that for people like us, tinder is dead for good and never coming back to the time where your chances are high of matching with someone you’re attracted to and that tinder is now just a psychological cash grab. 

Anyone else have similar experiences?",scam,ok headline little dramatic early tinder user recall time tinder organic could somewhere bar club next day youd see girls spot queue sort netted people went day nowadays algorithmic first approach app makes apparent true customer value longer main priority rather using algorithm drive revenue understandably so heres mean nowadays simply longer get attractive matches app used match range s s since beginning exposure attractive women plummeted state fact using tinder gold women see liked already literally s larger women gold first came wanted get people hooked feature seeing s already like could choose match loved it days tinder clearly shows profile women i am attracted to elo elo score exposure approach everyone raves about tldr feel like grandfathered accounts flagged high value prospects premium features revenue meaning continue give options youre satisfied with youll continue use app continue pay paid features truly believe people like us tinder dead good never coming back time chances high matching someone youre attracted tinder psychological cash grab anyone else similar experiences,tinder psychological cash scam
267,Did Tinder work for me?,4,4,02/02/2015,"""Does tinder really work?"" was the first question that came to my mind when my good friend introduced me to it.  I never really believed in finding someone through dating sites or in this case app.  I always thought of it as a place to find people to hook up with, which was the reason why I hesitated from downloading the app.  

What gave me hope was that, my friend have found his girlfriend through using Tinder.  Hey, if he could meet someone, that means that I could find someone!

Okay, lets say I started using Tinder towards the end of September/beginning of October & had stopped beginning of January... within the couple of months I have deleted Tinder for about I would say, 3 to 4 times. Basically I deleted it after the dates didn't work out. I kept telling myself ""you're wasting your freaking time on here"",""you keep meeting/talking to the weirdos"" but still I held onto that hope, that I would find that special someone. 

Fast Forward to New Years Eve >>>>

December 31st, 2014
*swiped Left, left, left*... ohhh he's cute... but he only has one picture .. hmm is he a catfish? Let me give him the benefit of the doubt and swipe right..

I proceed to swipe right, trying to get to know this person through one picture. As I swiped right, I received a notification that we matched.  I was having dinner with my cousin, as this Tinder cat-fish guy and I started talking.. Of course, he used a cheesy pick up line, which I thought was corny, but still gave him the benefit of the doubt. He then asked me to play connect 4.... -___- really? I said no, then he asked to play hangman..... no. Then I said, ""I'm more of a 20 questions kind of girl"", thru the 20 questions we learned basic stuff about each other... Fav color is green, he's Vietnamese, Marine man, 27, etc. Last 4 questions he was very slick haha, last question was a bonus question.

18. First date, where would we go?
  -That would be up to you
19. If we were to date what day out of the week would it be?
  - Sunday
20. What time should I pick you up?
  - Omg lmao smooth

**bonus question**
Can I have your number?
  -not yet.

After I had said, not yet. We still continued to talk, as we were talking on tinder, I was looking at his Instagram (I had asked him for his IG when we were playing 20 Questions) because at this point I was hoping that he was not a catfish but I had a good feeling that he was not a catfish..

Basically gave him my number later on the night, we texted, texted, and texted. We also continued to play a round or two of 20 questions. 

Next morning (New Years Day).. I received a good morning text from him.  We then continued to talk through out the whole day...  he asked me what my new years resolution was I said ""To wear my seat belt more often, hbu?"" then he replied, ""You."" I was confused, what does he mean ""you""?... Does he just want a hook up or something serious?  That followed by me telling him ""you know I'm not looking for a fling right?"" he said ""treat me right & I'll treat you right"", or something along those lines haha.

We texted & texted, then one day he said ""can I call you?"" i was somewhat shocked that he asked me that. I agreed, we then talked on the phone... then he asked ""would you like to meet Jenny (his cat)?"" which I know, that was code words for ""lets FaceTime so I know you're not a catfish."" We then FaceTime, and let me tell you, the conversation that we had was very, very nice.  It was effortless, it just came so natural.  We were being ourselves & having fun. 

We talked, & talked day after day. I went back on tinder to see how far he was away from me and it said 35 miles, just like how i saw it when I swiped right for him.. we then talked where we we're from and he told me where he was from which kind of shocked me because I did not think that he was that far from me.. which kind of turned me off because i was in a long distance relationship before and commuting back and fourth is very time consuming... and from pumping gas all the time, kind of burned my wallet... BUT I still gave him the benefit of the doubt.

The weekend was coming... im going into the city to grab a drink with a friend... then I decided to text him later that night saying ""what if i came to meet you?"" I can tell he was excited yet also a bit nervous.. fast forward... got to his place, we hung out, had a good conversation, he kept complimenting me and I can tell he was sincere about it.

As the night went on... I kept thinking, you know he's an awesome guy but this long distance thing is not going to work out.. I told him that later, I can tell he was a bit sad.. Thought that would be my last time seeing him... I was sad too because we did have a lot of stuff in common that would be hard to find in other people. 

I left gave my last kiss, as I thought... haha
He texted me afterwards saying that ill be worth it, you know the sweet stuff guys say to you when they either want something from you (-___-'') or they really are interested in you, I can tell he was interested in me.  I continued to text back to him, I picked up his phone calls, we talked and talked... then one day I realized that I do want to get to know this guy more.. Its not easy finding someone that's genuinely nice.. 

After a couple of days of talking, I find that I'm liking this guy more and more... now this may seem like its going fast, and trust me it was going pretty fast... but it felt right... next weekend rolled around we plan on seeing each other again, this time I got butterflies seeing him.. He told me he was going to make me dinner, and he did.  As we were on our way to Wegman's he asked me a question and made me stop breathing for a bit ""Do you want to be my girlfriend?"" I was blushing so much and could not stop smiling... I said yes! 


------------------------
Its been almost a month since we've been together, even though right now its just a honeymoon stage, it feels really nice.  He cares for what I have to say, and he actually takes in what I would have to say too, now you're probably going to think otherwise, meaning that it'll be too good to be true, but as of right now I'm liking where this is going. Good laughs, good communications and good times. 

I did say long distance is tough but we both are commuting back and fourth to see each other, I'm trying to put that aside and look at the whole picture :]

268,Something is fishy......catfish-y...,4,19,13/02/2019,"Has anyone downloaded tinder and it wasn’t the updated version? If so, please tell me. 

I deleted my tinder because I thought an ex friend had hacked into it and catfished as me. Before I came to that conclusion, I had casually downloaded tinder, one night.. just to see what’s up. I opened the app, it wasn’t the updated version with 9 photos and a spotify anthem. Which is odd, because normally apps don’t go back to the old format. 

Anyway. I have it stated in my bio that I have a boyfriend and that I was on there to make friends. I match with some cool looking dude and he tells me that my bio says I’m dtf and that I’m single. Kind of threw me off because the bio I see, says otherwise. I ask him if he can please send me a screenshot of my bio, I also told him the entire story as to why I need it. Next thing I know, my tinder format goes back to the updated one and he disappeared. No screenshots.

It was just too much of a coincidence. I blocked that chick and then deleted my entire tinder account.

I tell my boyfriend I’m going back on there to try and make friends again because maybe everything was blown out of proportion. I download it last night, same format as the last time. I deleted it and downloaded it again and now the formats keep switching. I don’t know what’s happening and I even called the private investigators.

They said they couldn’t do anything. I just want to know if the same thing has happened to anyone else to see if this is random or coincidental.

270,300km for a juice and 5 min talk (don't trust anyone on this app),4,8,20/04/2019,"(short version at the end) 

First of all sorry for my English, is not my motherlanguage so please grammar nazi stay away.

I live in Switzerland and i work in the military, for this reason i move around a lot in all the national territory. 
Last year in October i matched with this girl while i was located near the border with Lichtenstein, she was also from Switzerland but more up in north at circa 30 minutes from where i was, we started a conversation as usual on tinder and after some time we transferred to Whatsapp to continue there.

We tried to manage to meet but it was hard cause i was never able to leave the army base if not just at some hours of the evening in some days of the week, and the weekend i was home in the south region near the border with Italy where i live.

In the messages she looked a cool person, she said that i was interesting and blabla, she even used emoji with kisses and everything and i know it can seem a stupid thing but is a nice signal when you are texting with a girl imo

Btw we never met, and we kinda stopped talking, just few message that she sended to me with the photos of her vacation in Belgium, she even proposed another date, i said that i was free for all the week and she never responded

At the start of this month she texted me again and here start the weird part of my stupid story.
She sended an article about some stuff with American politics, and i responded like ""hey, time passed and we never met up, still want to?"" and she agreed!

After some messages we choose a day for meet, and keep in mind, not in a bar, not in a restaurant, she proposed me to go straight to her house, and before that she also proposed to take a room in a hotel together, what do you think this mean?

So the day come and she start to text weird in chat, like no emoticons but just small, serious messages and i was a little bit worried cause i was going for a 2 hours 150km roadtrip to reach her... She sended me messages like ""what's you current location?"" thing that i heard just from the bots of google maps haha and at my messages she start to respond just ""ok"" or ""no"" or ""yes""

I don't know... That was WEIRD as shit and i started to get scared cause i had some bad experience with dates, and she was from a border city with Austria, in these places criminality is common cause you can pass the border very quickly and leave Switzerland, and that's a red flag for me. Then, who ask to a internet stranger to go directly at her home in the middle of the night? That's another red flag.

I arrived at this shitty border city after 150Km and 2 HOURS of car and she gived me the information for reach her appartment, i followed the instructions and parked under her place. 

She tell me to go at the main door, ring, and go directly in her appartament upstairs (red flag #3), wtf, at this point i was scared, i had the feeling that something was terribly wrong and i even texted my friends and sending my gps location if i don't respond anymore. I was so anxious that i decided to bring my butterfly knife in my poket, i will not get robbed, i even hided my money and cards in my car before leave it.

I was down her house and i called asking if she can come down at the main door, just for see her and try to be more chill, she come down and omg she was so beautiful, too much beautiful i thinked, i know myself and im not the average attractive guy and girls like that never calculate me and that's ok, so here what's happening? It's not possible that the first time that a girl that looks like a model want a date with me we go directly in her house, red flag number 4!

I said to her that im sorry if i asked to come downstairs but i had some problems in some dates and i prefer to see who i met before enter in her house, i also said that i was pretty confused with her decision to meet me at her place and not a bar, also that i had no money on me cause i try to prevent robbery that can happen during dates with people met on internet.

She was smiling and laughing, very chill and saying yes yes i understand but know we go up ok? And i was hmmm ok let's see if i survive this night haha

At this point remember! She invited me at her places, she said that we meet at night, we sleep at her place and then the next day i leave and i was ok with this plan, so much travel but is worth of it.

I go upstairs and we start talking, she offered me a juice and she was super nice! I was relaxing, she said to take a seat on the sofa and i was ""woo it's not a trap, cool!"", we talk about her work, my work and some other stuff. After 5 MINUTES of conversation she said out of nowhere ""you know, i don't feel i want to do this anymore"" and become more serious, and i was ""what?"" i mean, what i done? Why she is interrupting everything?

And yes! You are thinking exactly, she said that she didn't want to do anything anymore and asked me to leave, WTF! i was out of words, i drived so long because she looked a nice and interesting person an now im literally getting ass-kicked out of her place, with NO EXPLANATION, just an annoyed ""sorry""

So yes, i drived back to my place angry as fuck and she never never texted me again (and mw neither) 

Now, in my opinion that was way too beautiful for be true, something was wrong, she was so over my standard, in a border city, she started to be more ""dark"" the day we have to meet and her reaction was just so nonsene... Maybe the fact that i said that i was not carrying any money changed everything, i will never know! 

What's your opinion?

At least i listened some podcast on my car, fuck

Lesson learned: NEVER drive for more than 30-40km for a tinder chick, you may risk to have drink a glass of juice and come back

It is clearly a photo of her in the profile but she must have made a dummy facebook account because it doesn't show that we share any facebook friends. I made a fake facebook account so that I could catfish her and get her chatting to see if she is actually there to meet guys or if she is just there for laughs/ attention. But I never find her profile when I use my dummy account. She lives only 2 miles away from me so it's really easy to find her on my main account. But as soon as I saw her on there on my main account I deactivated it so she wouldn't see me. But I don't get it- when I log on with my new, dummy account I see many of the same profiles I saw with my main account but I can't see hers. Does anyone know why? I went back and forth between my dummy and main 3 times to make sure she was still on there/ I didn't just swipe through accidentally and miss her. Help! This chick is seriously shady and I need to find out if she's screwing over my friend.

edit: This is weird.

279,Are all the girls who are looking for sex legit or is it all BS (please read my post inside)?,4,17,07/03/2015,"Hello

I'm new to Tinder. I have a few (4-5) matches from girls who message me instantly and say they just want to have sex and then try to send me to a website like ""supertinder"" or ""localsexfriends"" etc. where it asks you to sign up.

They say it's for their safety.

They are also good looking girls. Some sound legit. Some sound like bots.

Is it all just a scam? I have absolutely no experience with the whole local sex finder thing - strangers meeting in the night and all that. It's not something I've ever entertained for fear of being scammed, robbed, etc.

Is all this stuff BS? Is some of it real? Are these websites legitimate places for people to safely meet others for sex? And would women redirect from Tinder to these places for ""their own safety""?

I'm a bit curious about it all.

But in the end I come back to ""if it seems too good to be true, it probably is"".

Any insight at all would be welcome.

Thanks!

EDIT: One of them. The one that sounded legit has been unmatched with me. I guess after 10 minutes or so.

283,Am I getting catfished by this dude?,4,11,26/02/2018,"Sorry if this is a common question. Never been on here before.

Anyway I’m pretty new to tinder and I matched with this guy yesterday and Tinder doesn’t say his distance. We talk a bit and he tells me he’s in London but he’s traveling to Stockholm (where I live) in a few weeks and he’s “preparing” for that. So we talk a bit, flirt a little. We start talking on Snapchat instead but he doesn’t ask for nudes or anything like that. Then I look at his profile again and it says he’s less than a mile away. I ask him about that and he tells me he’s at the airport in Oslo about to go back to London and sends me a snap of the place. I tell him that Oslo is more than a mile away from Stockholm and he just says “I suppose.”¨

So I’d assume he’s just some guy using someone elses pics, but he hasn’t asked for nudes or done anything like that, just saying we should hang out when he comes here. He had Instagram linked to his tinder and it looked pretty legit. He had lots of pics and like 350 followers so I don’t know if it could be a dummy account. He’s fit but not like insanely fit. I’m sure there’s better looking people out there if he was just using a model’s pictures. I also found his Facebook where he had posted he was in Oslo for the weekend. Another thing that made me a bit suspicious was that his English was a little weird at times even though he said he was british, but maybe that could just be how he talks when texting.   
So I guess I’m wondering if Tinder can be completely wrong about location and I’m just overthinking this, or is he actually just some guy near me tryna catfish me or whatever it’s called? I tried googling distance being wrong on tinder but most people say it’s supposed to be pretty accurate.

Ok I just checked his distance again and it still says less than a mile away even though he should definitely be back in London by now if he’s telling the truth, but I read somewhere that Tinder only updates your location when you open the app so maybe that’s why? 

Shit I’m confused.  

TLDR: A guy on tinder says he's in a different country even though his profile says he's less than a mile away. Is he lying or is Tinder glitching?",catfish,sorry common question never before anyway i am pretty new tinder matched guy yesterday tinder doesnt say distance talk bit tells hes london hes traveling stockholm where live weeks hes preparing that talk bit flirt little start talking snapchat instead doesnt ask nudes anything like that look profile says hes less mile away ask tells hes airport oslo go back london sends snap place tell oslo mile away stockholm says suppose id assume hes guy using someone elses pics hasnt asked nudes done anything like that saying hang comes here instagram linked tinder looked pretty legit lots pics like followers dont know could dummy account hes fit like insanely fit i am sure theres better looking people using models pictures also found facebook posted oslo weekend another thing made bit suspicious english little weird times even though said british maybe could talks texting guess i am wondering tinder completely wrong location i am overthinking this actually guy near tryna catfish whatever called tried googling distance wrong tinder people say supposed pretty accurate ok checked distance still says less mile away even though definitely back london hes telling truth read somewhere tinder updates location open app maybe thats why shit i am confused tldr guy tinder says he s different country even though profile says he s less mile away lying tinder glitching,getting catfished dude

There is no particular reason to be discussing crypto at all and its not mentioned in my profile. Considering nearly every crypto asset is negative, I have no idea why these women are ""investing"" in it let alone talking about it.

287,"Is it a scam attempt ? ""can you buy some weed to someone I know before coming tonight; I give you cash back after""",4,14,14/01/2022,"Hi folks !

Just moved into a new city, created a Tinder account to meet people (you know, eh).

A match, regular looking girl (not Kim K nor Instabitch, but cute though), quick chat, and she quickly says hey I'm looking for a single night. I say OK, it's the purpose of this app, I don't mind.

We exchange a bit, she asks me if I smoke, she seems to smoke, bla bla balh, then she says we can see each other this week-end or tonight, I'm bored.

And here comes the tricky part : ""can I ask you a quite special question ?"" ""would you mind getting some weed to someone I know"" ""then I can give you cash right after"". I ask how much, I expected something like 20 €, damn, 100-150.

First, I never have cash with me, second, I don't feel it. It could be just a fake account, himself pretending to need weed, sell me some herbage or cooking herbs, and poof, nobody answers when I got the package.

I say her hey I don't have the cash, it'd be simpler if I see you first, you give me cash, I don't mind doing 2 km on bike to get your stuff. She didn't want it that way. Then I said OK, it's either my way, either I come and you don't get your stuff, you will have to wait for your friends or brother to get it as you always do.I asked if it was still up for tonight without that shit, she said no.

&#x200B;

I'm not naive, I think I'm little too precautious, but if that's not a scam, that would be an easy thing to do.

I didn't feel it, I reported and Tinder team should have a look at other conversation to see if this was recurrent.

I find this guy incredibly attractive and he seems like he has a good heart and is a good guy, a lot of qualities I'm looking for in a man. So I'm visiting DC on my vacation week bc I've grown to love that city and been thinking about moving there. I see this snap story pop up about flying to D.C. For his marathon. I remember him talking about his marathon but didn't remember him saying when it was and I had had this trip planned since before I knew who he was. Anyways.. so I'm just like ok, we're in the same city I'm just going to go for it and see what happens. I ended up snapping him my tinder profile pic (I actually look true to my photos) and asking him out for drinks. Do you ever get a feeling you know something will happen? So I sent it and went about my day. That doubt set in and I was like he's probably not going to reply oh well. He actually did. We had a quick convo. He was like still have to edit my video and was going to watch World Series. So he tells me where he's staying and basically says come hang out and gives me his number. Ok I'm a complete stranger and so is he. Let's go to their hotel. So I did. I'm half way expecting it to be a catfish even though I know it's not. Now I never get nervous around guys. He opens the door and I get nervous. I'm pretty sure he looked me up and down when he opened the door... but literally nothing happened so either he thought I was ugly or he just is a respectable guy. We just drank beer and watched the baseball game. Which honestly I'm kinda glad he didn't try anything bc it was nice to just chill with an interesting guy and not have any pressure. So was it like a date or just he wanted to hang out with someone? Was he attracted to me? Do men just give their number to any woman? Thoughts?",catfish,i m fairly intelligent probably brightest moment his came across guy social media following doesn t impress intimidate me i ended following snapchat he d respond snaps every never really actual conversation find guy incredibly attractive seems like good heart good guy lot qualities i m looking man i m visiting dc vacation week bc i ve grown love city thinking moving there see snap story pop flying d c marathon remember talking marathon remember saying trip planned since knew was anyways i m like ok we re city i m going go see happens ended snapping tinder profile pic i actually look true photos asking drinks ever get feeling know something happen sent went day doubt set like he s probably going reply oh well actually did quick convo like still edit video going watch world series tells he s staying basically says come hang gives number ok i m complete stranger he let s go hotel did i m half way expecting catfish even though know not never get nervous around guys opens door get nervous i m pretty sure looked opened door literally nothing happened either thought ugly respectable guy drank beer watched baseball game honestly i m kin the glad try anything bc nice chill interesting guy pressure like date wanted hang someone attracted me men give number woman thoughts,survived going guy s hotel room

On the call, I thought he sounded older than his profile said (24). I could be wrong, but either way, the voice was honestly a dealbreaker.

307,First Tinder Date Tonight,3,12,15/09/2015,"So, I'm four months post long term relationship break up and this evening I have my first tinder date scheduled. She's a very nice young woman that I matched with a few weeks ago and after a good conversation originally we've resumed our conversation. She immediately wants to meet up this evening to go on a walk as I mentioned previously I usually take a long walk  in the evenings. Seemingly to me she insisted that we be near where I live and I'm kind of unsure what she's thinking. 

I'm just curious if people with past Tinder experiences here can shoot me some wherewithal advice. I've told a close friend where and what time we're supposed to meet in case it's a ruse of the nefarious sort. I just don't know if I should go all boyscout and be prepared for anything. Do I bring condoms just in case? Do I need to make sure they aren't latex just in case there's an allergy? Do I need to set up a bug out call just in case she's a catfish? If a women is meeting up with you for the first time with intentions of sex what can I have or do that would settle the situation especially having met on Tinder. Am I just overthinking this whole thing and should just roll with it? I just get the impression she's looking to get physical. 

UPDATE BOYS AND GIRLS: 

Well as you can imagine by the hour at which I'm typing this update we did not in fact engage in the sex. It was an interesting evening, though. As planned she arrived outside of my residence and we did go on a walk that went quite well. We enjoyed each other's company and the conversation was light and honest. No physical contact beyond the initial hug at that point which is fine. After we walked back to my home we went up to my apartment where she was able to use the bathroom and meet my pup. The conversation lead us to deciding to grab some grub at the nearest Waffle House and nothing around us was open by that point. It was her idea and I agreed that it would be fun to have a little peace and quiet while we talked. The subject made it's way to different cultures of food we both enjoy when she mentioned that she's a vegetarian except for eating fish. This isn't unusual to me, but then she said it was because of religious reasons. She seemed the normal white chick so I was trying to figure in which religion those beliefs are held when she said the was a part of the Adventist of the 7th Day sect of Christianity. Now, I have never heard of this group. Not once. She described it as a branch off of Methodist, but more conservative. 

Ru-Row. I didn't even KNOW IT WAS POSSIBLE for a more strict sect, although i suppose maybe Baptists, but I am not up to date with my strictness rankings in Christianity's sects. I carefully planned my next move for fear of bringing the wrath of God upon my person as I did not know into which kind of hell, no really, I was entering. She excused herself to go to the bathroom and I swept my phone from my pocket and sent out an urgent text message to my friend that knows his religions quite well. ""Ed! (name changed) she claims to be an Adventist of the 7th day. If you don't know it look it up and let me know what I'm in for this evening."" Anna, as I'd rather not refer to the woman as she for the remainder of the story, came back to the table with a nice smile and the conversation continued. All the while, I could not stop thinking about this oddly named sect and it consumed my mind for a few minutes. I had no clue and it frightened me so. My concentration was broken by the sudden vibration in my pants. No, you pervs, it was my phone. ""Dude, if you thought Mormom was bad I don't have to look that one up."" 

I went on a date with a girl I slept with 5 or so years ago and turns out she's a Mormon. Hooray for the developing patterns of life! I don't want anyone to get the wrong impression here and think I'm some scumbag who looks down at people for different beliefs and ways of life because that's not the case. Back in college I spent a number of years in a relationship with a young woman who didn't believe in sex before marriage. A promise ringer as I've been known to call people with such beliefs. It's just not who I am anymore. I don't want to spend an entire relationship with the thought of if I want to have sex with this woman I have to marry her. I love sex. It's a ton of fun. I know I know, some girls are like that but they do other sexual things that make up it. Nah uh, those other things are great, but I like penetrative vaginal sex. 

Nope, I don't want to go through this stuff again. Issue is that we had a good time. We know each other through a mutual friend with whom I've done a number of Musical Theater shows and this came up in conversation. She asked me to sing some stuff from Phantom and Les Miserables. My bread and butter. We drove around my hometown singing musicals together, and had a great time. Also, she kept complimenting my singing which is akin to stroking my tail feathers, or telling Hank Moody he's a great writer. Purrr purrr ladies and gentlemen. After the singing and running to a friend's house to let out their dogs we returned to my apartment that she might go home. The evening ended well enough and she was doing the age old fiddling with her keys routine, which to my knowledge means a good night kiss is wanted. Guys, I'm off my game with this whole religion thing. I did the old stand by move of simply asking if that is something she wants or to hold off. I know I know I know! ""Just go for it breh!"" I was so unsure of how that goes with her beliefs. Can she even kiss before marriage? Is it that strict of a belief system? 

In my head I had blown it. The end date hug occurred. A sign of a negative ending. Womp womp womp. I guess it's better than that Mike Birbiglia joke when he goes in for a kiss and she said, ""No thank you."" She seemed to really want to set up another date, but I assumed it was conjecture after the hug. Nope, she began texting me immediately and wants me to come over to watch a movie at her place tomorrow night. So we'll see how that goes I suppose. I dunno what the deal is in this situation. I told myself a long time ago I wouldn't get mixed up with this sort of relationship again, but I figure what the hell have I got to lose?

After having done some research I've discovered a few more things about Adventists of the 7th Day I want to share. No alcohol, no premarital sex, church on Saturdays and they don't watch non-religious TV or engage in competitive sport on the Sabbath. Uhhhhhhhhhhh I love College Football. It's one of my favorite things to do, and there's a significant amount of booze in my booze fridge. It mentions being one with nature on these days which I'm totally down with as I love hiking, camping, rafting, and all that noise. Ahhhhhhhh.

I am weak. I'm going tomorrow. Come Adventists hell or high Sabbath I'm going. At least it could be a good story. Sorry this developed into such a long post folks and for all the grammatical errors and misuse of commas.

TLDR: Tinder. Adventists of the seventh day. No sex. No booze. No cursing. No red meat. ""Oh, no thank you."" College football. I am man. I am weak.

I've gone on a few Tinder dates before, all of which were enjoyable, with mixed outcomes. But those usually came within a week or so of the match. Due to the lockdown, this hasn't been possible for us. We've messaged every day. Conversations have gotten funny, deep and sexual (not at the same time). We have 'dates' where we set aside everything for virtual activities together. It feels like we're so compatible, and we talk as if we are going to be a couple. 

The thing is, I'm not one of those guys you see on Catfish that thinks they have a partner for life because of some affectionate messaging. I know there's a chance we won't feel the same connection in person. The more emotionally attached I get, the more that prospect scares the hell out of me. I'm going to be nervous for our first date in a way that I have never been before.

320,Has a scammer retaliated and got me shadow banned?,3,3,13/09/2021,"I've been using Tinder for about a month. On Sunday evening I was chatting to several people on Tinder, including somebody I've been chatting to for a while and messaging them is always very active, when after a while I realised I wasn't getting any replies. Still no replies this morning. There's no other changes to my account, I can still like people and I haven't received anything from Tinder. I don't get a lot of matches or likes but I usually get a few. Since Sunday evening, nothing. I have looked at the rules on Tinder and I honestly don't think I've broken any.

Since joining I've had a number of fake accounts match with me and a few have got as far as them requesting money (I've never paid). I got a lot of fake accounts contact me on Sunday and I unmatched and reported them as soon as I realised. I was playing along with one because their story was so bizarre (they claimed to be a soldier from Texas but currently deployed to Iran). They unmatched me but I had given them no reason to think I'd rumbled them.

I was chatting to somebody on Sunday (via WhatsApp) I was still matched with on Tinder. I realised they were fake (amongst other things they claimed a photo they sent me of them at a beach was taken in a city at least 100 miles from the sea) and I told them I knew what they were up. They sent a photo of their national ID card (that they conveniently had handy) and it was clearly fake. I unmatched and reported them on Tinder.

A week ago I was chatting offline to somebody whose match disappeared from my Tinder list. They asked for money, I revealed that I had already worked out they were a scam. They got very angry. The next day they reappeared on my match list and sent me a message. I didn't think this was possible. I unmatched and report them.

Have I been shadow banned, either because I've been reported by a scammer as retaliation or because I reported too many people? Any ideas of what to do now?

> An ongoing crypto scam that continues making the rounds can be found on the dating app Tinder. According to a Reddit post, one version of this scam involves Asian women (or individuals posing as Asian women) gaining the trust of their victims on Tinder before moving the conversation to Whatsapp or WeChat. Then the conversation turns to investments and “an inside tip about a new crypto asset” or the girl’s rich uncle who is a blockchain investor etc. Once the victims transfer funds, their money is gone. Hundreds of Tinder users have shared their experience in this Reddit post and others - although none say they actually fell for it.

Its pretty obvious whats going on as they both keep talking about crypto stuff every now and then, and one of the two is apparently a little team, as they managed to fuck it royally by contacting me via whatsapp twice, first time just as usual (but different name, story was that the app name is her ""stage name""), second time a day later with the name in the app. Phone number both times starting with +1 (im in Portugal...)

So, suggestions on how to waste the maximum amount of time of these twats?

323,Why Are People Afraid To VidChat?,3,11,15/07/2021,"I wanted to post this in /r/AskReddit but needed to give some context to my question. 

Three times in the past week, I’ve been deleted by women on OLD sites after suggesting we vidchat. I’ve been catfished in the past and like to vidchat before meeting to ensure there’s chemistry.  In each situation, the conversation was fun & flirty and I waited a few days before asking.  These sites have built-in vidchat so there’s no exchange of personal info.

So I’m trying to figure out what the issue is. If it’s about being shy, then how would we ever meet in person? If it’s about seeing unwanted dick (which I’ve never done because I’m not a street flasher) then why not simply agree for all parties to keep their clothes on?  Maybe I just had a bad string of luck and caught a bunch of catfish?

324,Am I being too old school or just too fast?,3,4,26/07/2020,"So I've been on and off Tinder multiple times and in doing so also changed my bio. Nevertheless, I always stress that I do not want to have endless text conversations as I personally think and have experienced a more genuine ""get to know"" when just going for a coffee (or tea). Plus even when I was texting for ages, people didn't want to meet up (either incompatible, shy or a catfish - who knows). 

Recently I had this girl who I was talking to - nothing serious. I asked her ""how about meeting up for a coffee"" like we both don't live far from a major city. She disagreed as she was shy and wanted to get to know eachother first on Tinder. I said ""no dice"", as my bio clearly said ""please let's not go full ham on texting"". She did unmatch me - fair play. 

But now I am doubting myself as in ""am I too old school for wanting to meet up rather than texting?"" or ""am I too straightforward/fast in asking for a coffee/tea and conversation?""
Also I know with Covid-19 it's not all that easy, but I also suggest people to have video dates - with which no success.

329,Catfish or paranoid?,3,10,10/07/2019,"So last night I matched with this chick who opened with "" Do you have a mirror in your pocket because I see myself in your pants"". I didn't think it was totally unusual since ladies have messaged  that they are dtf right out off the bat. In most cases we send pics back and forth plan a date but, ultimately usually falls through do to work and school.

So I go this chicks's snapchat and sends a snap of her boobs. It wasn't a saved image since the notification was red and it disappeared afterwards. She asked for a pic of my dong and I obliged. She complimented me and I asked for a pic of her ass. Then, she blocked me.

At first I assumed it was because I'm not super well endowed but, then I realized something.  Something seemed off about her boob snap. It did not contain her face and only a little bit of her mid section (probably about 3-4 inches above her belly button). Furthermore, one would be able to see a little bit of her rib cage while on your knees and puffing your chest out. They did not look like they belonged to a 110 lb chick. They were unusually saggy and large for a girl that size.

&#x200B;

When looking at her profile now a few things are quite note worthy. She only has one pic. The scale seems to be fine and it doesn't seem super blurry. She seems to be in the same league with most girls who I match with. In addtion a while back a matched with a girl who supposedly lived near by. She didn't want to send her snap right away and she started to ask weird questions like ""What are some of places you like to go?"". I immediately noped out of that one. The weird thing about this new chick's profile is that they were the same distance away.

On her snap she had a squiggly line were the score should be. At the time I didn't think much of it since most girls make new snapchat when they want to receive and send snaps but, they usually just have a really low score not a squiggly line.

The reason i am doing it is because tinder can be a bit empty as a bald guy. However i feel a bit as a catfish since i dont normally wear a wig. Then again i am just covering up a disase.

Obviously this was sketchy so I said I'm not doing that, and thought it's some kind of scam.

339,"If a catfish pulls the ol' flippero on me and reports ME as a catfish, am I fucked?",3,7,14/06/2022,"Back on the bandwagon after a rather horrible breakup last year - been going OK on Tinder, but tonight ""usage B"" reared its ugly head and backfired.

You've probably all heard of the Chinese cryptocurrency scammers on Tinder ([https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=44SG4obrYcs](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=44SG4obrYcs)) and I get this a LOT. For some reason I attract Chinese girls a lot on Tinder - I don't have an Asian thing, 90%+ of girls where I'm from, and therefore 90%+ of my swipes, are White British, but the majority who seem to match back are Chinese. No less than five genuine ones I've dated over the past several years, but easily 20+ scammers. Me and some mates have a little thing going where our ""second usage"" of Tinder is to wind these people up into thinking we're onto them and they're going to be arrested. Great fun!

I got one tonight, they're easy to spot early on if you know. I started to question it and pulled the flip, and they always shit themselves. This one started screaming saying they were going to call the police, calling me the catfish, saying I'm police, all sorts of mad stuff.

TL;DR - the catfish reported my account as a catfish. As you can see, I don't get much luck on Tinder (apparently 2-3 matches a year despite using every day is low?) so this is the *last* thing I need. Will this fuck my visibility up? Can I counter this at all? Like many of these scammers, they were verified, and I'm not. As we know, it's easy to get verified even for scammers, and they think it makes a difference and makes people trust them, sadly this may be true.

350,PSA: scammers on Tinder and possibly other dating apps,3,23,12/10/2020,"I want to warn you all of scammers on Tinder.
There are profiles of Asian women  looking somewhere mid tweenties on tinder that after a brief convo on tinder itself give you a (in most cases) UK phone number to continue chatting in WhatsApp. Sometime during the chatting they mention a new ""investment possibility"" in a new crypto coin ""Huawei 5g joint Bluesky Biomedical defence"" or short ""HWS"". If you don't bite at first, they ask you every at least once if you want to join and get more insisted every time.
They lure you on to binance.com (which is a legit site) to buy bitcoin, 5000$ at first to get a ""beta membership. Which you then transfer to a site hwsex.org and exchange for HWS chips.
When you ask if or when you can exchange back to bitcoin and transfer back to binance, they tell you you have to"" invest"" at least 2 bitcoin to get a ""full membership"" with which you could then do that (which you can't obviously).
Before anyone asks, yes I was dumb enough to fall for it (not for the full 2 btc but I burnt 0.5btc on it) 

Pleas everyone be careful if someone from tinder (could also be male scammers out there) talks about crypto and some new investment.

351,Why do I keep getting shown the same profile multiple times?,3,3,02/07/2020,"I already swiped right on this girl, why have I been shown her profile again? If I swipe right **again** do I loose another of my limited swipes? If I swipe left this time do we ""unmatch""?

361,How to Avoid Scam,3,0,21/01/2018,"I had the chance to speak on the phone with a Tinder scammer the other day. Long story short, the guy was forced to do it and he felt bad. Here's a few tips on how to avoid a scammer:


**1. Avoid incomplete profiles.**
The amount and quality of pictures is the first indicator. The general rule of thumb, if there's only one picture - you're better off swiping left. However, a valid connected Instagram profile might constitute an exception to this rule. Typically, you'd want to be looking for *at the very least* 3 profile pictures and a bio.


**2. Learn to detect red flags**
The first behaviour you should look out for is very aggressive texting. Usually, the girl will text you first and just seem way too horny overall. A good thing to keep in mind is that *even the most straightforward girls will want to feel your vibe before anything*. They might say ""Hi"" and reply with ""You're hot"" once you answered, but a legitimate girl clearly *wants to know how you will react*. If she wants sex or pictures before taking the appropriate time to feel you, just know that's not normal. 

Another behaviour that could potentially expose a fake is a weak sense of context. This is manifested through statements that may seem unnecessary at the moment or through answers that just feel kind of *off* - as though the girl did not take into consideration what you just said. This can also come through sometimes as a *clear* lack of logic.

Finally, if she seems a little too attached to a certain platform, watch out. There's a difference between being reticent (which is okay) and trying to convince you to stay on a said platform. The latter is a weird behaviour that constitutes a red flag.

To sum up, watch out for:

* Aggressive texting/sexting, especially if combined with a first text
* Out of context statements/replies
* Tries to convince you to stay on a platform
* Lack of logic


**3. Learn ways to verify the authenticity of a profile**
The first thing to look for is an Instagram account. Just having a linked Instagram account is a good sign. However, this can still be fake. If you have reasonable doubts, and what to investigate, you can always visit the profile. A high number of pictures and/or followers is the first thing to look for. If you can, reading through the comments would be the very best way to get an idea. If she's engaged with her followers, chances are she's real.

The second thing you want to verify is her sense of logic. If you suspect you are speaking to a bot, start referring to common knowledge (ex.: I've been wondering, how hot is it really in the Carribean?), or make a typo (I love fhtg). The bot will most likely trip up and look very obviously unreal. The use of pronouns help a lot too, bots have trouble keeping up with pronouns such as 'it' or 'they'.

Then, you'll want to bring her out of Tinder (obviously). Optimally, you would want to get a phone number, but I wouldn't recommend giving yours out first. Scammers could potentially use this information for malicious reasons. If you do get her phone number, the first thing you should do is call. Don't even bother to ask or anything. Just call. You'll either get to talk to her directly and engage in conversation (good!) or you'll be directed to her voicemail, and often, that can be a good indicator. In my particular case, the voicemail WAS what threw me off (another name, male voice). 
Otherwise, Snapchat would be good also. When dealing with Snapchat, you want to go for a live picture (you both should do this).
You'll see, if she gives you some weird excuse NOT to call or NOT to send a live snap, YOU SHOULD WATCH OUT. Whatever the excuse, it really isn't valid. She should be able to find a way to send you a live picture (someone's else phone, facetime, wtv.) or set a time to call if not now. 

To sum up:

* Check for a valid Instagram account
* If in doubt, verify logic through common knowledge, typo and/or pronouns
* Use another platform to chat
* **Get her on the phone, FaceTime or send live snaps**


**4. Make use of your judgement**
The tricky thing with online profiles is that you can't really know for sure if it's fake or not. What if it's a real person? I suggest you take it easy until it comes to calling or sending a live picture. That's the real test. Until then, just be aware of the red flags mentioned above, but don't make a big deal out of it. You don't want to throw a potential date off because you're being paranoid. You don't have to be a dick, or fully confront your doubts. In the end, the only thing you'll really want to do is hold off sending sensible information, or pictures, before you can be sure you are dealing with a real person;) Phone calls and live pictures/videos are the Tinder CAPTCHA - make it mandatory, and simple.",scam,chance speak phone tinder scammer day long story short guy forced felt bad here s tips avoid scammer avoid incomplete profiles amount quality pictures first indicator general rule thumb there s one picture better swiping left however valid connected instagram profile might constitute exception rule typically want looking at least profile pictures bio learn detect red flags first behaviour look aggressive texting usually girl text first seem way horny overall good thing keep mind even straightforward girls want feel vibe anything might say hi reply you re hot answered legitimate girl clearly wants know react wants sex pictures taking appropriate time feel you know that s normal another behaviour could potentially expose fake weak sense context manifested statements may seem unnecessary moment answers feel kind off though girl take consideration said also come sometimes clear lack logic finally seems little attached certain platform watch out there s difference reticent which okay trying convince stay said platform latter weird behaviour constitutes red flag sum up watch for aggressive texting sexting especially combined first text context statements replies tries convince stay platform lack logic learn ways verify authenticity profile first thing look instagram account linked instagram account good sign however still fake reasonable doubts investigate always visit profile high number pictures and or followers first thing look for can reading comments would best way get idea engaged followers chances real second thing want verify sense logic suspect speaking bot start referring common knowledge ex i ve wondering hot really carribean make typo i love fhtg bot likely trip look obviously unreal use pronouns help lot too bots trouble keeping pronouns it they then want bring tinder obviously optimally would want get phone number recommend giving first scammers could potentially use information malicious reasons get phone number first thing call even bother ask anything call either get talk directly engage conversation good directed voicemail often good indicator particular case voicemail threw another name male voice otherwise snapchat would good also dealing snapchat want go live picture you this see gives weird excuse call send live snap watch out whatever excuse really valid able find way send live picture someone s else phone facetime wtv set time call now sum up check valid instagram account doubt verify logic common knowledge typo and or pronouns use another platform chat get phone facetime send live snaps make use judgement tricky thing online profiles can t really know sure fake not real person suggest take easy comes calling sending live picture that s real test then aware red flags mentioned above make big deal it want throw potential date paranoid dick fully confront doubts end thing really want hold sending sensible information pictures sure dealing real person phone calls live pictures videos tinder captcha make mandatory simple,avoid scam
362,Suspicious asian accounts popping up on my Tinder,3,10,27/02/2022,"I recently got a match from a supermodel-looking asian model with an Italian (of all things) name. Obviously I realised it was some kind of scam or catfish for one reason or another, but I tried to talk to them and played dumb just to see what the deal was about. The conversation was reasonably normal, and after wondering whether I'd be down to go out in about a month or so they asked for my WhatsApp, to which I responded with hesitancy (regarding giving out my phone number). Since I didn't get a response afterwards, I figured that was that and soon forgot about it.  


Until another very similar account cropped up, and once again they have a European name (Bulgarian this time) with the same supermodel-tier pictures. For the sake of sheer curiosity I've gone ahead and matched, but before I get the chance to sus them out myself: has anyone else had something similar happen recently? I did some Googling and reddit-searching and found threads about similar things from about a year ago, but the answers weren't clear-cut and I am really curious what others have to say on it.

388,Are all the girls who are looking for sex legit or is it all BS (please read my post inside)?,2,17,07/03/2015,"Hello

I'm new to Tinder. I have a few (4-5) matches from girls who message me instantly and say they just want to have sex and then try to send me to a website like ""supertinder"" or ""localsexfriends"" etc. where it asks you to sign up.

They say it's for their safety.

They are also good looking girls. Some sound legit. Some sound like bots.

Is it all just a scam? I have absolutely no experience with the whole local sex finder thing - strangers meeting in the night and all that. It's not something I've ever entertained for fear of being scammed, robbed, etc.

Is all this stuff BS? Is some of it real? Are these websites legitimate places for people to safely meet others for sex? And would women redirect from Tinder to these places for ""their own safety""?

I'm a bit curious about it all.

But in the end I come back to ""if it seems too good to be true, it probably is"".

Any insight at all would be welcome.

Thanks!

EDIT: One of them. The one that sounded legit has been unmatched with me. I guess after 10 minutes or so.

391,Struggles of a bisexual [23M] on Tinder *Sigh*,2,4,16/08/2020,"I feel so shitty. I am a bisexual male who is on Tinder and is facing some struggles.

I feel like men are a bit more easier to connect with. And women have a bit higher standards and I face a bit more hurdles. But apparently Tinder is a hook up app for straight people, but I don’t get those vibes. Can someone walk me through how they have hooks up on the “straight” side of things ? 

I was so excited to match with a girl on Tinder. And the conversation was going smoothly. I asked more questions than she did about me. I must admit, I became distracted and the text messages slowed down for ONE DAY.  Out of no where, she unmatches with me. 

I feel kind of hurt. This has happened to be me TWO TIMES BEFORE. There was another girl that I really liked and she unmatches me out of no where. 

Was I being too chatty and conversational ? Did someone “out” me ? Is my profile not “straight enough” 

The women I match with are so far and few in between. My tinder is open to both men and women. I don’t put that I am bisexual in my profile. My profile pics are “masculine” (whatever tf that means— I try to stay away from words like this). So I do not know why girls don’t find me attractive enough to swipe right on me. I get much more matches with men. 

Does Tinder push bisexuals to the bottom of the algorithm ? 

Maybe it’s because Tinder has much more heterosexuals on the platform ?

I wonder who else these women are matching with. Are there just more “men” to compete with in the heterosexual side of things ? Are women more picky when it comes to the app. I also have a feeling that these women are fake on the app too (catfish of sorts)

Any other apps beside Tinder ?

393,Did I just come across a fake or possible catfish on Tinder ?,2,10,05/02/2017,"I matched with a guy a few days ago, he responded fairly quickly to all my messages. I noticed on his profile that he had absolutely NO common connections and his bio only says NY•CA. It also does not show how many miles he is away from me. He has 5 pictures, one of them does not show his face at all (he's facing back) and the other 3 show side angles and one shows a not so clear picture of his full face and body. However, all three pictures that do show his face look fairly consistent. I gave him my number & he has been wanting to meet up. I ask for his FB, he says he does not use one. I ask for his IG he says that he has one but no pictures of himself on it. He were supposed to meet up today but he has been very flaky. 

I just think it's odd he has no common connections or it doesn't show how many miles apart we are. He has a 1(386) area code which is from Florida (when I looked it up) but he claims he is from NY. We text normally but it's a little short, he doesn't reveal much and is vague. He says he lives around my area and even mentions the street he lives on which indeed exists in my city.

400,Asian ladies Scam on Tinder,2,6,24/12/2021,"Hi, i am here to expose how certain Asian women are scamming lonely men. They almost had me ready to make a deposit. This is the story.
There is a prevalence of beautiful single, widowed, divorced asian women on Tinder, and other sites.
They are absolute barbie dolls. Their main goal is to scam money on the pretense of investing in crypto. 
Here are the signs to look out for.
First of all, looking at these women, you will realize that they ALL look very similar. That is because the majority of them have had plastic surgery.
Bigger eyes, slim nose, shaved jaw , bigger breasts, and longer legs. ( That topic , I will cover later).
All get the same procedures. Now, most don't have finances to get surgery.  So, they get very expensive, hard money loans.
#2. All will be involved in business, finances,and crypto
#3. They will all look and claim successful venture, and say they want to help you.
#4. They will ALWAYS TEXT, never ever speak w you. Because 99% can not speak a word of english.
#5. They will always put off meeting you.
#6. When texting, they will ALWAYS take a long time to respond. They have to translate what you texted.
Gentlemen,  their beauty and seemingly genuine interest in you will be your downfall.
I am speaking as an Asian-American who almost handed over 10k to a gorgeous girl. She really had me fooled.
The one thing that stopped me , was my friend called.
He called and excitedly told me of a girl he just met on Tinder.

428,How Common and Direct are Hookup Matches in Your Experience on Tinder?,2,8,10/02/2022,"Hi all,

First post here. I rarely use the app and while I'm ready to give hooking up a go, it's a totally new and kind of scary experience to me due to my upbringing (32M, virgin, laugh if you want)

How often do y'all encounter people who are dishonest about their intentions on the app? Either catfish, thieves, or trolls?

I matched with a beautiful woman about my age just across the border last weekend (I'm in El Paso, she's in Juarez) but we didn't get a chance to meet. Last night I figured I'd give messaging her a chance bc what the hell, right? 

We had a wholesome conversation about me learning Spanish (I'm a very white ethnically German by descent) and the struggles and sometimes funny parts about learning the language and some generic banter.

 This lasted about an hour. At the end of the conversation before I went to bed I brought up a part of her profile I didn't initially see.

Most of her bio was flirty stuff in English and Spanish to the effect of cheesy but wholesome pick up lines like her parents badgering her for grandkids, what we would name our dogs, etc. Then, the last line of her bio is a short 1 liner that is a total 180 about her being dtf.

I asked her what part of her bio was serious and what was a joke and her response to me was that she was looking for no strings attached casual sex.

This is coming from an incredibly attractive, ostensibly intelligent, and educated woman, of a different ethnicity and culture.

Her photos are verified.

In your own personal experience, what do you think the odds may be that she's being authentic and not trying to rob me or just troll me?

This whole experience is new to me and both exciting and terrifying.

For background, I'm a bit concerned that something may be off for several reasons.

1.)I'm an ugly duckling and late bloomer and still struggle with my self image so I frequently self sabotage

2.)The concern over safety between El Paso and Juarez as I'm new to the area

3.)The possibility that if we do meet I may just be a mark to get jumped since I'm a gringo and not her kind. This concern may be a little unfounded and something I'm going to have to get over regardless. I'm a 6'5"" white giant with a preference for Hispanic women so I just gotta come to terms with that, I guess.

Highlights on convo and a pic of myself for reference. IDK if it's against terms to post a pic of her.  There is about another 30 minutes worth of conversation before my 1st screenshot, just basic stuff.

If this is legit, even if it doesn't end up happening given the time between now and us actually meeting, I have no idea how someone so attractive is interested in me.

&#x200B;

Edit to add pictures bc I'm bad at reddit and couldn't get them to upload with the text.

429,Gave my phone number to someone I probably shouldn't have. Am I just being paranoid or did I do something very bad?,2,2,09/01/2015,"Got matched with a really attractive girl who apparently lives somewhat nearby. At first I thought she was a bot, mostly due to the fact that she seemed totally out of my league, but we chatted a bit and I'm fairly certain that I was talking to a real person. What I'm not certain of is whether or not the person I was chatting with was an actual 18 year old asian girl with a super model body.

After making small talk for a couple of days, she messages me and says ""U want me to text u so I get your number? I'm on my tablet (phone's broken) but what's your #?"". 

I'm a bit confused by this and I ask her how we could possibly text if her cell phone's broken. She responds saying that her phone's broken but she can text via an app on her tablet. 

At this point I'm a little bit hesitant, but I send some screen caps to a friend and he insists I go for it. Carpe Diem and whatever. I send her my phone number, and I receive a strange text that says ""Spotlight Verification Code"" with a multi-digit number that I won't be telling you. Shortly after that, I receive another message on tinder from her asking me to tell her that number, because she needs it to be able to text me. I sigh, contemplate it a bit, and then send her the code. To play it safe, I ask her on tinder if she's a hacker (adding a ""hahaha"" to soften the accusation). She responds with a ""no lol"", so I'm obviously safe. Obviously, right? 

I get a text message from her a few minutes later with her name, and I respond with my name and and a smiley face because I'm a flirty motherfucker. I don't hear back from her. Couple hours later, still no response. I go back to Tinder, and she's gone. Not sure if she deleted her profile or if she only unmatched me, but there's no trace of her. 

I tell this to a few other friends and they think she's some kind of scammer. I look up the phone number she texted me with and the appears to be somewhat nearby. However, the initial number that sent me the verification code is from the states (I'm in Canada). 

I text her a simple ""hey, what's up?"" about six hours after the number exchange, and now, 4 hours after that, I am still waiting for a response. 

SO 

has anyone hear ever faced something similar? Do you think this girl is legitimate and I'm just a paranoid loser or did I walk right into some kind of scam?  If I am being played, where do I go from here? 

I think I'm done talking to cute girls.

450,"How to Spark a Flame w/Tinder, 8 Steps",2,9,10/03/2015,"1. Be as selective as possible
    -Tinder is a tool to select your perfect 10, you can find 6s, 7s, 8s and maybe even 9s at your local watering hole. So don't waste your right swipes on anything less than your dream girl.

2. Once matched: Be Normal
    -First impressions are huge: 'how's your day?' Will get you more responses than 'want me to send a dick pic?'

3. Share FB info
   -Show that you aren't hiding anything and you have a real life, share your fb profile and ask your other party to do the same

4. Find commonality
   -Once you had a chance to scope out her fb, find something that you both have in common and discuss, this will create an easy conversation allowing both people to let their guards down: music, shows, movies, hobbies, etc.

5. GTFO of tinder, get digits
   -So you met a smoke show, she digs you and you both, as an example, love going to music festivals=this girl rocks. Next get her digits and stop talking through Tinder. Tinder is a place where people search to find possible matches. You have your match so there is no need for the Tinder environment and you want her thinking less of finding other matches and meeting up with you. Grab her digits and start texting.
 
6. Begin texting
    -Don't blow it, stay casual and keep the conversation fun. You are no longer just a tinder match but a contact in her phone. Make your way to ask ""what are you doing this weekend?""

7. Skype, no catfish 
    -People are always hesitant to take the plunge and actually meet. Understand this fact and share that you are just as skeptical as the rest by offering to hang out via FaceTime/Skype.  This way both people can rule out either one is a Catfish and confirm what they look like. Before you end the session, call out the fact that neither of you are catfishing and schedule a date to meet in person. Don't schedule anything more than 5 days out or you risk people 'forgetting'--you want to ride this wave of communication right in to your first date.

8. Go on a date
    -You have talked the talk, now walk the walk. Be yourself and everything should be fine. If either person is late, you have their number so don't leave the other person hanging.

Make it happen and if she is your perfect girl, don't let her go.

456,Revive a dead conversation?,1,7,01/12/2016,"Resubmitted because due to the account age, I think the first post got caught in the spam filter.

I think I will use this as my r/Tinder account, due to some people IRL knowing about my main one. I have read a few threads about this, but felt I needed more context-based advice and answers.

I am not a very attractive guy. I have heard I am average or slightly above average. I would consider myself either a 7 or 6.5 on a good day. My matches have been reflecting this, at most I have been matched with a 7. However, while the correlation might not be 100% clear, since adding a picture with a cat, I have not only recieved more matches, some of them have been very attractive as well. 

Five days ago, I matched with a girl who actually messaged me first. Since she had no mutual friends or interests in her profile, I assumed at first she was a bot, but it wasn't obvious so I went in with the benefit of the doubt. Turns out she wasn't. Her first picture was stunning and the others weren't bad as well, definitely not a catfish (unless it was old pictures). Plus she had at least one big mutual interest I discovered in our messages.

Unfortunately, I think I might have blown it because even if my game is improving after a month of using Tinder and learning some of the do's and don't's that aren't that obvious, it's still not very good and I answered to one of her questions with a very long answer. I tried to compensate for that by splitting it up, but that might have been worse even if I sent them at the same time. FYI, the question was about what I am studying. It did contain a follow-up question. She has so far not replied. The reason why isn't obvious though, even though it doesn't look very good.

Now, I usually don't care that much if a match stops replying. I do however care about some matches more than I do about others obviously. In addition to that, I live in a city of about 120k. The influx of new profiles is about 6 per day (19-24, 25 km), which is pretty slow. And I don't feel like resetting before I get some new, better pictures so I don't get easily recognized.

Since I mentioned that I don't know her reason for not replying, I want to make an attempt to revive the convo because I really have nothing to lose. There is a problem with that, because you appear needy which you never should appear like. Which is why I don't want to make an attempt before the weekend earliest. We hadn't sent many messages really, so it doesn't look very good, but it might be worth a try.

Now, I wonder if any of you have been in a situation like this, and if you actually managed to successfully revive a conversation that was presumed dead. Or, more specifically directed towards women, did you ever stop replying to a guy and then he actually sent something later on that made you actually respond and continue the convo where it was left? What did he send and how much later was that?",catfish,resubmitted due account age think first post got caught spam filter think use r tinder account due people irl knowing main one read threads this felt needed context based advice answers attractive guy heard average slightly average would consider either good day matches reflecting this matched however correlation might clear since adding picture cat recieved matches attractive well five days ago matched girl actually messaged first since mutual friends interests profile assumed first bot obvious went benefit doubt turns wasn t first picture stunning others bad well definitely catfish unless old pictures plus least one big mutual interest discovered messages unfortunately think might blown even game improving month using tinder learning do s don t s obvious still good answered one questions long answer tried compensate splitting up might worse even sent time fyi question studying contain follow up question far replied reason obvious though even though look good now usually care much match stops replying however care matches others obviously addition that live city k influx new profiles per day km pretty slow feel like resetting get new better pictures get easily recognized since mentioned know reason replying want make attempt revive convo really nothing lose problem that appear needy never appear like want make attempt weekend earliest sent many messages really look good might worth try now wonder situation like this actually managed successfully revive conversation presumed dead or specifically directed towards women ever stop replying guy actually sent something later made actually respond continue convo left send much later that,revive dead conversation

Would you be mine?' she then asked me to send her a dirty video which I of course politely rejected. We sexted for a bit and throughout she really seemed to want a basic non dirty face photo. I sent her no pics obviously and the weird thing is, while she could be fake, she wants to meet up for of course only one reason only but she says her camera is broken so She couldn't send me any pics apart from one of her face, not taken on the same device. From the gallery.

So what do we think guys? She is also hot so adds to the mystery. I asked if I could call her and she seemed to back away at first but she agreed to tomorrow.

472,"Does anyone know what this ""scam"" is all about?",1,0,04/07/2022,"So like many people I've long had issues with Chinese scammers on Tinder and the like. Now I'm not averse to the Asian type and for some reason they seem to like me - last 3 relationships have all been Chinese girls and I've even matched with a few who thought it was to make friends, and we are. Fine, all good.

But while I did get the classic ""invest in my cryptocurrency"" thing that is well known, I've had a massive run of them lately who are a little different. They all show as being based in the UK near me, but then live ""in Singapore"", have a Malaysian or similar number, and are ""moving to the UK soon to open a business"". Normally they own a fashion store, sometimes they have one in another European city (often Paris) a rich uncle is normally involved. It's the same awful broken English because the guys who run these scams are barely literate in Chinese nevermind English. 

But while in the past they'd normally get onto some mad cryptocurrency that they're ""investing"" in and how ""they can only trust a man in a relationship who will trust my investments"" and loads of personal shit designed to guilt losers into falling for it, lately there's been none of that. 

Long conversations about when they're coming over, their plans, how we can meet up, etc etc. I keep waiting for scam as me and some friends run a little thing where we flip it on them and they shit themselves, but it never comes. They send photos, a few have even done video calls (obviously some worker in the place they run the scam from) and the like, 

Then....nothing. They just go quiet. I don't get it, what's their aim here? Why bother? I know none of them are ""real"" so I'm not bothered about that, but I am admittedly a little pissed they don't even give me chance to throw their scam back at them!",scam,like many people i ve long issues chinese scammers tinder like i m averse asian type reason seem like last relationships chinese girls i ve even matched thought make friends are fine good get classic invest cryptocurrency thing well known i ve massive run lately little different show based uk near me live in singapore malaysian similar number moving uk soon open business normally fashion store sometimes one another european city often paris rich uncle normally involved awful broken english guys run scams barely literate chinese nevermind english past they d normally get onto mad cryptocurrency they re investing they trust man relationship trust investments loads personal shit designed guilt losers falling it lately there s none that long conversations they re coming over plans meet up etc etc keep waiting scam friends run little thing flip shit themselves never comes send photos even done video calls obviously worker place run scam from like then nothing go quiet get it what s aim here bother know none real i m bothered that admittedly little pissed even give chance throw scam back them,anyone know scam about

I was obviously asleep and didn't reply until the next day when I was on lunch break. I said I had it but uninstalled but I could reinstall. 

And I said it was kinda funny she was asking fory snap at midnight. Just some gentle ribbing like she must have been feeling horny or wanted a booty call etc. I didn't actually say that to her, I just said it was funny she was asking at midnight.

Anyway today we were chatting and I said again it was funny she askede atidnifht because she didn't acknowledge that before. And she went off at me and accused me of not having snap (I figured she implication was she thought I was fake). But honestly I'm not good looking enough to be a catfish. 

Anyway she just said lol bye and unmatched me.

She just turned nasty and aggressive then unmatched me.

So weird. Sour taste again. But at least I can see the red flag and bullied dodged. Obviously she's got no sense of humour about herself.

But it just irks me that until recently I've had nothing but positive experiences on tinder. Even with people I have realised I'm not that interested in people have always been polite and friendly and wished each other well etc.

So anyway she texts me her butt, while asking what I think, to which I respond, 'I'm thinking (censoring flirt too embarrassing to write again). Immediately she's asking if I want to come over this afternoon for sex.

Naturally I recommended we meet in public, suggesting it would probably be safer for her. She felt there was no reason to, but I didn't want to get robbed/raped/pranked so I insisted. 

Her last text was 'we'll talk later, got to get back to work.'

I mean she's not a model, she's in my league really. I keep reading about about how some of you say you should meet in 48 hours, but this is the quickest it's ever moved for me and I'm feeling a little suspicious.

552,West Elm Caleb Incident is kinda overblown.,0,1,28/01/2022,"Ok. I think this is a good sub for maybe my opinion. So its been a week since the west elm caleb incident on tik tok. And ive had time to think. Now for those out of the loop. West elm Caleb was a name given to some random dude in a beanie who took multiple women on dating apps on dates. He love bombed them. Which means he gave them gifts and compliments and gassed these girls up. And when he had sex he dipped. He ghosted. Love bombing is essentially a tactic to keep girls hooked on you. And he did this to many women. I dont know why he got a lot of hate. 

Like Caleb is a upper class 6 ft 4 white dude. Whos not bad looking. Ofc he would be popular with upper class white women. Is this a shitty thing to do? You bet. Its not pleasant. But is it dox worthy? He wasnt racist or sexist or homophobic. He didnt diddle any kids or sexually assault these women. He just dated many women.These ladies are mad that he was dating multiple women and like gassing them up and ghosting when half these women do the same. These women got a rotation of men in their dms. And they go on multiple dates with many dudes getting free meals and shit and pretending they love these dudes just to friendzone him(yes the friendzone doesnt exists. Its a boundary. Its up to you if you wanna stay friends) or ghost him or never respond to his text introduction on tinder.

Oh dont get me started on tinder. Its horrid. Many women put their social media in their tinder bio so that you follow them and give them free clout and attention. And the guys they do talk to or date they have many of them they have as backup. But do i see men doxxing these women?

No. Because we as men know that. Thats why we are guarded and we dont invest so deep at the beginning. And we are told if we are ghosted that we should take that L anf move on. Stop being an incel and move on. Take rejection and take emotional manipulatuon and pain and women using you for free meals or free clout and entertainment. This shows that women cant take rejection at all. Just as bad as men. But as men in society we are told to just take the L. Why cant the women do the same. Cause Caleb made them feel not special. He cut off their validation cold turkey. And ladies dont tak3 that well. Look at femaledatingstrategy on what they think of Caleb. They say hes low value for dating many women and bombing them. When their sub explicitly says for women to have options, use men for free meals and how to connive men into being monkeys for them. So hypocritical. Now this is no hate to women. As i said Calem did some toxic shit but its nowhere near the magnitude of evil shit some of these women do. Pretend cry, insult men, use 5hem for free meals, ghost them. Fuck their exs best friend or their brother. Like these women are proud of it on tik tok.

This isnt a post saying woman bad. But moreso showing hypocrisy. If a man uses tinder like a woman hes a bad toxic man who needs to be hung and fired from his job and made a mockery and cancelled for no reason(he did no bigotry or pedophilia or rape). When women wear toxic on their sleeve. And they are proud of it and never called out. 

This wasnt dox worthy. Hes just a regular dude who does what every one and their mother does on tinder. And blame that on the culture online dating has produced.",sexual assault,ok think good sub maybe opinion week since west elm caleb incident tik tok ive time think loop west elm caleb name given random dude beanie took multiple women dating apps dates love bombed them means gave gifts compliments gassed girls up sex dipped ghosted love bombing essentially tactic keep girls hooked you many women dont know got lot hate like caleb upper class ft white dude whos bad looking ofc would popular upper class white women shitty thing do bet pleasant dox worthy wasnt racist sexist homophobic didnt diddle kids sexually assault women dated many women these ladies mad dating multiple women like gassing ghosting half women same women got rotation men dms go multiple dates many dudes getting free meals shit pretending love dudes friendzone him yes friendzone doesnt exists boundary wanna stay friends ghost never respond text introduction tinder oh dont get started tinder horrid many women put social media tinder bio follow give free clout attention guys talk date many backup see men doxxing women no men know that thats guarded dont invest deep beginning told ghosted take l anf move on stop incel move on take rejection take emotional manipulatuon pain women using free meals free clout entertainment shows women cant take rejection all bad men men society told take l cant women same cause caleb made feel special cut validation cold turkey ladies dont tak well look femaledatingstrategy think caleb say hes low value dating many women bombing them sub explicitly says women options use men free meals connive men monkeys them hypocritical hate women said calem toxic shit nowhere near magnitude evil shit women do pretend cry insult men use hem free meals ghost them fuck exs best friend brother like women proud tik tok isnt post saying woman bad moreso showing hypocrisy man uses tinder like woman hes bad toxic man needs hung fired job made mockery cancelled reason he bigotry pedophilia rape women wear toxic sleeve proud never called out wasnt dox worthy hes regular dude every one mother tinder blame culture online dating produced,west elm caleb incident kin the overblown

562,Video Series - Tinder Platform Review + What to watch out for + Feedback for female Tinderettes,0,0,02/02/2021,"Hi All,

I've recently discovered a series of videos on YouTube of what appears to be an English bachelor reviewing Tinder profiles (Mainly females) and giving an opinion of said profiles, for example how they can improve their Bios and photos for better presentation to potential partners. He also highlights the scam profiles and Gold diggers, so its very educational in that sense.

There appears to be an element of comedy thrown in as well to help keep the viewer engaged and entertained. Obviously, they are not malicious videos and should not be taken seriously.

So a few weeks ago i got matched with a girl, who turns out she is a performer at strip club.
Right after my cheesy pickup line, she asks me what i was going to do that night, and eventually she suggested i go see her at her workplace.
I couldn't go at the time, but i told her i would go today.
She's been very nice all the time and oddly close, calling me babe and stuff.
Could it be some kind of publicity stunt? Should i go see her?

569,It's a Small World (or Why You Should Never Open with Rape Jokes),0,17,05/03/2015,"Swiping away a few days ago, when this one cute girl catches my eye...not only is she the only other vegan I've come across on Tinder so far, she actually lives in my little town! (Most of my matches come from the two neighboring cities.) She mentions something about liking wheels in her bio, and to show her your bike. So I message her with this not-even-funny joke about how I don't have a bike, but my rape van totally has wheels (followed by ""just kidding, it's not a rape van, it has windows""). She is not amused. Any joke containing rape references isn't funny, she says. So, rather than dropping it and moving on, I attempt to argue the objectivity of her statement, and in so many words call her ""too p.c."" Days later, she still hasn't unmatched me. So last night I go to Publix to re-up on groceries, and this cute girl is ringing me up. ""Find everything ok?"" ""Oh, yeah..."" ""That's what we like to hear. Oh! I love Amy's soups!"" And I'm about to be like, ""Hell yeah, have you tried the spicy chili? It's off the chain,"" but I manage to get out ""Hell yeah..."" before it slowly dawns on me that this girl already looked familiar, and now she's commenting on my vegan soups. As I trail off, I read the nametag, and my suspicions are confirmed as my face goes beet fucking red and my throat instantly dries shut. All I wanted was to apologize and offer to take her out for coffee or something lame like that to make it up, but instead I did my best to avert eye contact while she finished ringing me up, swiped my card and got the fuck out of there. If that's not bad enough, I sent her this on Tinder: ""Oh God, you work at my Publix! Sorry about the rape joke."" Great, now I'm a creepy rape joke guy that knows where she works. Fml.

I said I'd be down to go with her and then she gave me her #.

I texted her and she immediately said ""Want to buy my nudes"" and I replied ""No, but I'd gladly fuck you"". She agreed and she asked if she could come over my place. I made an ultimatum - let's do a video chat to ""Make sure we're both comfortable"" and so I could make sure she's legit. She agreed, and later recanted saying she's no longer interested, but proceeded to ask for a picture immediately thereafter. I offered to meet her halfway at a hotel room and she said she didn't have money for gas and asked for $15. 

Also, she also kept contradicting herself and then correcting herself. For example - She said 6pm was too late for a video chat because she had to work but then almost immediately asked if I wanted to come over her place tonight. I reminded her she had work and she said she called out

601,A small rant about idiots.,0,10,22/06/2020,"I (30m) been having plenty of matches during the quarantine and continue to play after with moderate success in matches. A few stunners here and there, mostly average kind of chubby (super chubby) girls and then a few 6 and a half that could turn into 8s and 9s with the right face. At least half of them replied which is good, and about a 10th of them managed to keep a conversation past the initial couple of messages. Here's what bothered me though :

Out of 100+ matches, there were less than 3 that were actually nice enough to have a conversation with. About half of them would not respond within 3 days. Of those that did respond the better looking ones would either play mind games and be aggressive or respond with 1-2-3 words; horrific conversationalists. Of the remaining ones, most of them asked to followed on Instagram which is a scam of its own. And then of the few (like 10 of them) that I have not listed yet, most would be so bad at being interesting people; no interests, nothing to do but talk to friends and get boys attention in tinder to fill their emptiness.

And guys.. This is what killed me before I wrote this shit rant of a post.. Out of the 3 that would not be wannabe insta models, attention seekers or straight up crazy people, this is what I heard that hit me right in my ballsack.

Fucking extreme guys?! It wasnt extreme posting all your photos and personal life details plainly for everyone else who is a stranger to see but if it is someone who you consider dating who is asking, it gets to be extreme?!

This really fucking killed me a little on the inside... Especially since the previous girl I asked for Facebook, offered Instagram instead and she is clearly half assing an attempt to create followers. Women have no ethos for romancing truly...

I found it weird she wants to meet in the park after it’s dark. I told her I couldn’t do 8 and to do tomorrow. She said that’s fine. Curious to see if tomorrow is also the park after dark.

Also I'm not getting any girls that appeal to me as in thw beginning and thw ones that do probably don't like me back.

652,GloryHole Request 4 Weeks Into Tinder,0,12,14/04/2020,"Guy here. Mid 30s. Fit, attractive, and have a good job. Very lucky to have that job in these times, and I feel for everyone who is struggling now. I hope this story will cheer you up. This event occurred over a month ago so corona wasn’t a big deal then, and I was on the hunt. I do WFH on a regular basis, and I was WFH on this day.

Background:

Broke up with long term girlfriend of 4 years and am getting back into the dating scene. Ex-girlfriend was a 9, but I’d be lying if I said I got 9’s easy. She was work, and was only the second 9 I actually landed. Anyway, pretty much have no game now but am working my way up the ladder on Tinder. Screwed it up at first by swiping right on every profile. Matched with 150+ hippos. Not saying hippos don’t need lovin’, but I’m fit like a bobcat over here. Have you ever seen a bobcat try to fuck a hippo? Me neither. 

So I scroll through all of that, and find 10 people (out of 160), that I actually want to talk to. I know—it’s my own fault, and that’s what I get for trusting one source on the internet. The idea was to swipe right on everyone and then sort it out from there. Bad idea.

Main story:

I match with this hot blonde 20-something-year old girl. A legit 10. Let’s call her K. She messages me first. Red flag. Why is she doing this? 

K tells me about how she ran 4 miles in 30 mins this morning, and all that jazz. I ask K if she’s looking for a running buddy on here. Once again, my game is terrible. She dodged the question and asks if I’m close by. I am. I ask again what she’s looking for on here. She flips the question and asks me instead. I tell her I’m not looking for a relationship or a one night stand, but want to find someone with good energy who I can chill with on a regular basis. K says okay but she’s only looking for casual. I said, great, that’s what I’m looking for. She then says no, because I said I wasn’t looking for hookups. Uh...yes I am....weird. I ask for her number. She skips my question and asks me what I do for a living. I’m vague about it. It’s strange, because I’ll ask her questions, and then she’ll completely ignore them and ask something else. She asks for my phone number. I give it to her. She’s so fucking hot I don’t even care that we can’t have a legit conversation.

K texts me right away. It’s the around 12:30 in the afternoon. She asks me if I’m looking for fun right now. Dude...a fine ass girl is asking ME if I want fun right now—WTH? This has to be a scam—that’s what I’m thinking. I tell her no because I’m working. She asks if I need to be logged into my computer all the time. I tell her no but I have conference calls and can’t have some gorilla-sounding shit going on in the background. I didn’t say it exactly like that, but I told her she’d have to wait. 

At this point, I say, fuck it, I should call her. I do. Rings for a second, and goes to VM quick. You can tell she sent it to VM. No biggie. She then texts me back and says “Did I ask for you to call me?” I’m thinking damn, you’re hot, but you could also be a serial killer or a tattoo artist—that’s shit I need to know beforehand. And what’s up with this attitude? Is it normal to have that type of attitude when someone calls you? Maybe...in this day and age...? Guess I should’ve texted. Idk. 

Texted her back and said if we’re gonna meet up I should at least talk to her beforehand. I also told her I wanted to make sure she wasn’t a dude. I’ve said this line in the past and it got another girl to call me instantly after we’d been chatting for several days. I’m not trying to waste time here, and if you’re some dude fucking with me, I want to know right away. K then pretended like I didn’t say anything. She said I was too busy and I should go back to work. She was gonna take a nap. At 1 in the afternoon. Okay, fine. I’m thinking, that’s the last of it, but I was so wrong.

Fast forward 4 hours later. K texted me. She says she’s only interested in me if I’m into her fetish. She then waits for my response....but she didn’t tell me what it was! I’m thinking, there is some legit bullshit going on here. There’s no fucking way some fine ass girl is messaging some random (albeit attractive) guy with no game just out of the blue. I was honestly about to tell her she can’t kick me in the nuts and shit on my face—I don’t care how fucking hot she is. I didn’t say that tho. I screwed up an earlier potential hookup being an idiot like that, and I’m trying not to do that again. Apparently, some attractive girls on Tinder are actually DTF (without much game needed). I never knew. Crazy. Seriously!! WTF?! But I’m not sure about that here. This girl is weirdly secretive all the time. I’m thinking she’s a dude or she’s gonna have her buddies steal my wallet when she’s got a hold of my dick, or something. Of course tho, I’ll entertain her, and she tells me her fetish. 

She said she has a gloryhole in her house that is a hanging bed sheet with a hole in it. This hole is directly to the left when I enter her home. She says her fantasy is to meet some random guy, have this guy feel her fit body (her words, not mine), and then for her to pleasure him through the gloryhole. Said it turns her on. 

WHAT...THE...LITERAL...FUCK? Is this real life? K’s a stunner, and she basically wants me to come over and put my dick in her? No date or anything? Like...I don’t need to go down on her? Jesus Christ there’s no way this is real! Let me remind you tho that I did mess up a prior encounter with a girl who was very forward, and I thought she wasn’t real. She was, and I screwed it up royally. So I still have that playing on in the back of my mind.

I tell K we need to FaceTime because we need to see what each other looks like before doing this. I’m not trying to get catfished here. She says no—she only does snap, and she doesn’t do cam shows. Wth? Cam shows? I just want to see your face and hear your voice before I stick my dick in your mouth. Chivalry is not dead I say. Told her I don’t have snap but can FaceTime. She says no. I then message a buddy of mine and he tells me I need to get snap. Says it’s great for sexting. 

Downloaded snap. Message her again. Then, listen to this, she says she thinks she’s gonna pass because she’s not feeling the vibe. Whaaaatttt? WHOA...HOLD ON...you can’t turn me down! I’ll turn you down you crazy girl, but, what? Wait, she is? She’s turning ME down...so there’s the potential that she’s real? And now she’s pissed that I wouldn’t budge before on snap....? She’s thinking I’m too much work now? Whhhhaaattt? Did I REALLY fuck this up? Really? 

Didn’t know what to say, and still thought it was a scam. Told her I appreciated her not ghosting me and I wish her luck on her future adventures. She tells me I ruined it by saying too much. Basically, because I thought the whole thing was a scam, I approached it like such, and joked around a lot. I didn’t think she was real, and it never crossed my mind that some people are actually, legitimately, totally fucked up, and they may be hot! There may be some legit reasons for being on the DL with this shit—nobody wants their parents to know about their tinder encounters, and she just takes it to an extreme. I mean...think of all these fine ass girls in porn, right? Some of them are 10’s, and if one of them said they wanted to fuck you, you’d do it, right? God! Maybe I did screw this up!

I responded to her saying I was just trying to be safe. She replies and says I’m not being serious and that I just wanted to be nosey. Texted her one more time after that to apologize and appeal to her hotness, but to no avail. Ugh...she went dark.

So...what do you guys think? If she sent you some snaps of her before going over to her place, would you do it? Would you put your dick through that bedsheet hole if you knew there was a fine ass girl on the other end? My buddy says I fucked up. Said some ppl are on the DL. Says maybe she was a cam girl, and she wanted to find a rando attractive dude on tinder. Then she’d fuck him for her customers watching on the other end.

Okay....yeah...maybe...but then I’ll be in some porno! My buddy responded “Yeah, but, just your dick.” 
Fair point. 

Seriously tho, would you guys actually meet up with her? If you had somebody knowing where you were, and checking up on you? I just think so many wrong things could happen...if I survived tho—this story would’ve been much more interesting!

TL;DR: Fine ass girl messages guy on Tinder. Guy has no game. Girl proposes guy to meet up for gloryhole bedsheet encounter at her house. Guy thinks she’s too hot to be wanting this shit. Guy jokes around because he thinks it’s a scam. Turns out it might not be a scam, and girl gets upset with guy’s lackadaisical approach. Girl tells guy exactly how he screwed it up, and is not a bitch about it—she actually seems disappointed. Guy cannot believe he didn’t pursue it further.",scam,guy here mid s fit attractive good job lucky job times feel everyone struggling now hope story cheer up event occurred month ago corona wasnt big

She uploaded a picture that was obviously taken before or stolen from someone else. She didn't want to make a picture right now. However, her tinder account was linked to her instagram (with a lot of pictures). 

She sounded annoyed that I thought she was fake, but I think a catfish would probably react the same way to keep up the charade.

So I match with this girl who actually seems pretty normal but is interested and attractive nonetheless. We have drinks, a lot of sexual tension going on, we start making out as we're walking back to my car so I invite her over. She had ubered to the date so she rode with me. As I'm driving she starts kissing me and grabbing my balls. She pulls him out and starts going at it. Top 5 best head of my life ngl. Had my toes throwing up grand signs and I was dissociating she was so fucking good. Almost crashed twice but nbd.

We get to mine and it's straight to bed. She tells me I don't need a condom cause she has an IUD. Not the first red flag of the night but def the biggest one. I insist on the condom just for safety sake and she's disappointed but goes with it. I tell her I'm gonna finish and she tells me to take the condom off and cum inside her. I again tell her no and she tells me that if I don't take it off, she won't let me finish at all. I'm like wtf ok I don't need you to finish I can do it just fine on my own. She gets mad, goes to the bathroom, and I do my thing.

She's in there for a decently long time and I'm kinda just chilling til someone rings my doorbell. I open up to see the fucking cops standing there saying there were called over a possible sexual assault. My date walks out of the bathroom and tells them that I raped her. I have cameras in my room for this very reason so I'm not worried and the cops start getting our info go to their computer and pull me aside. The one trooper tells me that she has called the cops 3 times in the past week for the same reason and that she's done it a dozen times in the past year so they're very familiar with her. He basically tells me to stay away from her for my sake and tells her she can't keep doing this. She starts crying, saying that no one ever believes her, and then literally just walks away. I'm guessing she called an Uber eventually.

 She texted me 3 days later apologizing and asking to come over again to make it up to me. Me being a man, I'm very tempted but think better of it and just block her.

When I’ve matched, I say “hi” and get zero response, I say “hi, which area/state are you from?” if their profile doesn’t indicate which city, but says they live nearby like 10 miles or something, since I live close to the border of another state, again no response or maybe just a two-letter state response then crickets. I say “hi” and get a response that immediately sounds like a scam when they ask me what’s my job as the first question, and it’s  already clearly listed in my profile.

I’m a straight guy, interested in an LTR leading to marriage, so in my tinder profile I’ve listed out deal breakers, pretty much covering 4 or 5 essential/deep topics that, if people don’t see eye to eye, would 100% NOT be good for long term or even marriage. 

I have zero interest in wasting my time waiting months to address these topics and end up getting answers that I know would make us incompatible for long term, and even when I get matches, it seems like when I reiterate my deal breakers in the few tinder convos where I’ve gotten a “hi” back, I get replies like “I don’t want to answer that now” or “am I being interrogated?”

I’m literally asking the same respectful questions I would ask on a face to face 1st coffee/dinner date, so the way the “women”(or scammers maybe?) get offended with me asking the same questions basically already in my profile is perplexing.

Do you think it’s actual women getting offended at my upfrontness with the seriousness questions, or is it just scammers?

Thanks for any insight!",scam,hello community ive yet actual back forth messaging convo tinder tinder premium months dont need see actual message convo screenshot anyone curious back forth gist message convo thats actually lead date thats lead ltr ive matched say hi get zero response say hi area state from profile doesnt indicate city says live nearby like miles something since live close border another state response maybe two letter state response crickets say hi get response immediately sounds like scam ask whats job first question already clearly listed profile i am straight guy interested ltr leading marriage tinder profile ive listed deal breakers pretty much covering essential deep topics that people dont see eye eye would good long term even marriage zero interest wasting time waiting months address topics end getting answers know would make us incompatible long term even get matches seems like reiterate deal breakers tinder convos ive gotten hi back get replies like dont want answer interrogated i am literally asking respectful questions would ask face face st coffee dinner date way women or scammers maybe get offended asking questions basically already profile perplexing think actual women getting offended upfrontness seriousness questions scammers thanks insight,actual tinder conversation back forth look like

667,"Why is this sub cool with putting peoples faces and names from a private dating app out there for everyone to see (600,000 people)?",0,6,03/12/2017,"I just say this as it's a private dating app and a lot of the posts sometimes it's even someone trolling someone and engaging *them* then taking their face and name and putting it here for half a million+ people to see.

Or other situations. It just seems fucked up if I'm honest.

I just think if I saw a male version of this sub. Where women and  instagram culture like ""mean girls"" 600,000 in number took pictures of average guys and stuff they find funny about us, like ""lol who does this guy think he is trying to be that confident when he is 5'2 in his photograph""  (making a post of a guy who is really short in all his group photos then laughing at his dms or part of his bio) or making reference to guys looking broke as fuck or a guys penis or other stuff we would hate it. Fair enough men can be submitted here but think about if it was 99% posts of men and as described and with identifying info, big photos and names, people would point to it as proving the nastyness of female nature.

Imagine (as guys often are unsuccessful or lack good game) you try messaging a match and you say something embarrassing and then you find you name and face on a subreddit for 600,000 people to see with people critiquing how you look and also how lame you are. And mirroring the sort of comments about women here  but for men, saying how you seem you don't get out much or don't get pussy/ have never had a gf.

Just imagine a sub filled with posts with guys faces and names and a convo that goes like ""hey, how are you glad I matched with you"" and then the girl stringing him along and joking as if she likes him then making a massive joke or pun message sent to him. Then the girl uploads the convo and his face while keeping herself anonymous. And comments laughing about how the guy had no chance of pussy, same style as comments here that make fun of some women seeming promiscuous.

I understand I'll probably be downvoted and attacked for this but I really can see the image of this sub featuring the opposite slant and focusing on men and I'd hate to be featured here with my  name and face plastered fully.

**/r/creepypms features people that often say abusive things or are flat out disgusting examples of people and they have all identifying information removed and no facial pictures. But this sub has people who are on a private dating app and are often contacted by someone making jest at them or have private conversations taken with someone they were interested in screenshotted (fine) but along with their face blow up and name (fucked up). And instead the dynamic is that the person soliciting the reaction is often anonymous and the person unsuspectingly using a private dating app has their name and face released.**

669,West Elm Caleb Incident is kinda overblown.,0,1,28/01/2022,"Ok. I think this is a good sub for maybe my opinion. So its been a week since the west elm caleb incident on tik tok. And ive had time to think. Now for those out of the loop. West elm Caleb was a name given to some random dude in a beanie who took multiple women on dating apps on dates. He love bombed them. Which means he gave them gifts and compliments and gassed these girls up. And when he had sex he dipped. He ghosted. Love bombing is essentially a tactic to keep girls hooked on you. And he did this to many women. I dont know why he got a lot of hate. 

Like Caleb is a upper class 6 ft 4 white dude. Whos not bad looking. Ofc he would be popular with upper class white women. Is this a shitty thing to do? You bet. Its not pleasant. But is it dox worthy? He wasnt racist or sexist or homophobic. He didnt diddle any kids or sexually assault these women. He just dated many women.These ladies are mad that he was dating multiple women and like gassing them up and ghosting when half these women do the same. These women got a rotation of men in their dms. And they go on multiple dates with many dudes getting free meals and shit and pretending they love these dudes just to friendzone him(yes the friendzone doesnt exists. Its a boundary. Its up to you if you wanna stay friends) or ghost him or never respond to his text introduction on tinder.

Oh dont get me started on tinder. Its horrid. Many women put their social media in their tinder bio so that you follow them and give them free clout and attention. And the guys they do talk to or date they have many of them they have as backup. But do i see men doxxing these women?

No. Because we as men know that. Thats why we are guarded and we dont invest so deep at the beginning. And we are told if we are ghosted that we should take that L anf move on. Stop being an incel and move on. Take rejection and take emotional manipulatuon and pain and women using you for free meals or free clout and entertainment. This shows that women cant take rejection at all. Just as bad as men. But as men in society we are told to just take the L. Why cant the women do the same. Cause Caleb made them feel not special. He cut off their validation cold turkey. And ladies dont tak3 that well. Look at femaledatingstrategy on what they think of Caleb. They say hes low value for dating many women and bombing them. When their sub explicitly says for women to have options, use men for free meals and how to connive men into being monkeys for them. So hypocritical. Now this is no hate to women. As i said Calem did some toxic shit but its nowhere near the magnitude of evil shit some of these women do. Pretend cry, insult men, use 5hem for free meals, ghost them. Fuck their exs best friend or their brother. Like these women are proud of it on tik tok.

This isnt a post saying woman bad. But moreso showing hypocrisy. If a man uses tinder like a woman hes a bad toxic man who needs to be hung and fired from his job and made a mockery and cancelled for no reason(he did no bigotry or pedophilia or rape). When women wear toxic on their sleeve. And they are proud of it and never called out. 

This wasnt dox worthy. Hes just a regular dude who does what every one and their mother does on tinder. And blame that on the culture online dating has produced.",assault,ok think good sub maybe opinion week since west elm caleb incident tik tok ive time think loop west elm caleb name given random dude beanie took multiple women dating apps dates love bombed them means gave gifts compliments gassed girls up sex dipped ghosted love bombing essentially tactic keep girls hooked you many women dont know got lot hate like caleb upper class ft white dude whos bad looking ofc would popular upper class white women shitty thing do bet pleasant dox worthy wasnt racist sexist homophobic didnt diddle kids sexually assault women dated many women these ladies mad dating multiple women like gassing ghosting half women same women got rotation men dms go multiple dates many dudes getting free meals shit pretending love dudes friendzone him yes friendzone doesnt exists boundary wanna stay friends ghost never respond text introduction tinder oh dont get started tinder horrid many women put social media tinder bio follow give free clout attention guys talk date many backup see men doxxing women no men know that thats guarded dont invest deep beginning told ghosted take l anf move on stop incel move on take rejection take emotional manipulatuon pain women using free meals free clout entertainment shows women cant take rejection all bad men men society told take l cant women same cause caleb made feel special cut validation cold turkey ladies dont tak well look femaledatingstrategy think caleb say hes low value dating many women bombing them sub explicitly says women options use men free meals connive men monkeys them hypocritical hate women said calem toxic shit nowhere near magnitude evil shit women do pretend cry insult men use hem free meals ghost them fuck exs best friend brother like women proud tik tok isnt post saying woman bad moreso showing hypocrisy man uses tinder like woman hes bad toxic man needs hung fired job made mockery cancelled reason he bigotry pedophilia rape women wear toxic sleeve proud never called out wasnt dox worthy hes regular dude every one mother tinder blame culture online dating produced,west elm caleb incident kin the overblown
670,Possible Catfish?,0,2,27/02/2015,"Just looking for some advice on a situation, so I meet a person on a forum for EDCLV was just looking for some advice etc. they turned out to be pretty cool and we started talking for about a month now.

The strangest one was she posted a picture of herself on a thread and you could see the phone in the shot and the last thread she posted was with her stating she had just got the Iphone but in that picture she had a S4 I would have never noticed but someone called her out and it and she said that she took that pic on her moms s4 which seems a little fishy to me. She gave me enough information to find her Facebook but I haven't looked much, I don't want accuse her of being a phony and then me actually be in the wrong since she has helped me a lot on finding good deals etc for EDCLV but then aging I don't wanna be lied to, and if someone is using pictures for a person Facebook acct. shouldn't they be told? any advice?

671,The 'Swipe Night' game,0,11,13/09/2020,"Just wondering how many people noticed this in the Swipe Night game..

There is a scene where one of the characters is, supposedly, doing something nefarious (may be 'cheating') in the bathroom with another character..

The first character's SO then throws a drink directly in the first character's face in retaliation when the 'possible cheating' is exposed..

Just wondering what Redditors think of this in 2020?  Is Tinder the defacto standard of modern dating behaviour?  Is it okay to 'assault' an SO in response to suspected cheating?

672,Tinder has turned me into a catfish. And I hate/ love it.,0,7,20/05/2014,"So tinder has really taken off in my area lately and despite not being that social I decided to join the fun. I don't have that many good photos and wanted to rack up the matches to get as much conversations going as possible so I borrowed some from an attractive friend abroad. I've hit about 500 in 2 weeks and this is outside a fairly small city. I've had some terrible chats but also some good ones and now I'm starting to feel guilty. Some of the girls are clearly interested in meeting up and we get on well in text but I imagine lying about my appearance is a huge deal breaker.
Anyone else experience something similar? I imagine the healthy thing to do is delete the account and move on but I've found going on tinder really enjoyable and my pick up game has gotten a lot stronger once I am able to not worry on appearance. I'm really intrigued about telling the truth to some of my better matches but I predict it would be shameful and embarrassing for all involved.",catfish,tinder really taken area lately despite social decided join fun many good photos wanted rack matches get much conversations going possible borrowed attractive friend abroad i ve hit weeks outside fairly small city i ve terrible chats also good ones i m starting feel guilty girls clearly interested meeting get well text imagine lying appearance huge deal breaker anyone else experience something similar imagine healthy thing delete account move i ve found going tinder really enjoyable pick game gotten lot stronger able worry appearance i m really intrigued telling truth better matches predict would shameful embarrassing involved,tinder turned catfish hate love it
